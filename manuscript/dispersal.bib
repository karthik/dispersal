abstract = {A simple null model, particularly germane to small and vulnerable organisms such as parasites, is that local conditions set a stage upon which larger-scale dynamics play out. Soil moisture strongly influences survival of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), which in turn drive trophic cascades by protecting vegetation from root-feeding herbivores. In this study, we examine the mechanisms responsible for patchy occurrence of an entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis marelatus, in a California coastal prairie. One hypothesis proposes that biotic factors such as competition and natural enemies could regulate occurrence of EPN populations. We found that fungi and other enemies of EPN, although locally potent, did not explain the patterns of incidence across sites. Abiotic factors also have strong effects on EPN persistence, especially for vulnerable free-living stages. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that patchy occurrence of EPN on a large landscape was driven by differences in soil moisture. Our research uses long-term data on nematode incidence in combination with a landscape-level experiment to demonstrate the lack of a correlation between soil moisture and long-term persistence. A year-long experiment showed EPN mortality was weakly correlated with soil moisture among our study sites. Thirteen years of data, however, showed that colonization rates were highly correlated with long-term persistence. Sites with highest long-term persistence experienced the highest rates of rhizosphere colonization, extinction, and turnover. As a result, we concluded that metapopulation dynamics override limitations set by local and short-term abiotic conditions to determine long-term persistence in this parasite-driven trophic cascade.},

abstract = {One of the primary objectives in population ecology is to understand mechanisms that allow a species to persist or to be driven to extinction. In most population models, individuals are assumed to be equivalent within any particular category such as age, sex, or morphological grouping. Individuals within such groupings, however, may exhibit considerable variation in traits that can significantly affect population trajectories. Although ecologists have long been aware of such variation, they are frequently ignored to maintain computational tractability. The few statistical models that do incorporate such heterogeneity require prohibitively large amounts of data on many individuals, making them impractical. In California's coastal prairie, a parasitic nematode, Heterorhabditis marelatus, is an important natural enemy, whose presence determines the strength and extent of a trophic cascade. Mortality of H. marelatus is strongly influenced by habitat and seasonality, which determines long-term persistence. Prior efforts to estimate mortality have suffered from difficulty in distinguishing between measurement and process error due to limitations in experimental protocol. In this study, we eliminate measurement error in the initial population size and focus on the true nature of the heterogeneity in mortality. By including individual heterogeneity in our statistical model, we are able to understand how this species is able to persist over seasonally harsh environmental conditions. Further, we extrapolate these findings to larger population sizes and illustrate that heterogeneous survival can have a significant effect on the emergent number of survivors.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades, whereby predators indirectly benefit plant biomass by reducing herbivore pressure, form the mechanistic basis for classical biological control of pest insects. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are lethal to a variety of insect hosts with soil-dwelling stages, making them promising biocontrol agents. EPN biological control programs, however, typically fail because nematodes do not establish, persist and/or recycle over multiple host generations in the field. A variety of factors such as local abiotic conditions, host quantity and quality, and rates of movement affect the probability of persistence. Here, we review results from 13 years of study on the biology and ecology of an endemic population of Heterorhabditis marelatus (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) in a California coastal prairie. In a highly seasonal abiotic environment with intrinsic variation in soils, vegetation structure, and host availability, natural populations of H. marelatus persisted at high incidence at some but not all sites within our study area. Through a set of field and lab experiments, we describe mechanisms and hypotheses to understand the persistence of H. marelatus. We suggest that further ecological study of naturally occurring EPN populations can yield significant insight to improve the practice and management of biological control of soil-dwelling insect pests.},

abstract = {1. Animals move commonly through a variety of landscape elements and edges in search of food, mates and other resources. We developed a diffusion model for the movement of an insect herbivore, the planthopper Prokelisia crocea, that inhabits a landscape composed of patches of its host plant, prairie cordgrass Spartina pectinata, embedded in a matrix of mudflat or smooth brome Bromus inermis. 2. We used mark-release-resight experiments to quantify planthopper movements within cordgrass-brome and cordgrass-mudflat arenas. A diffusion model was then fitted that included varying diffusion rates for cordgrass and matrix, edge behaviour in the form of a biased random walk and heterogeneity among planthoppers (sessile vs. mobile). The model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood using the numerical solution of the diffusion model as a probability density. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) values were used to compare models with different subsets of features. 3. There was clear support for models incorporating edge behaviour and both sessile and mobile insects. The most striking difference between the cordgrass-brome and cordgrass-mudflat experiments involved edge behaviour. Planthoppers crossed the cordgrass-brome edge readily in either direction, but traversed the cordgrass-mudflat edge primarily in one direction (mudflat to cordgrass). Diffusion rates were also significantly higher on mudflat than for cordgrass and brome. 4. The differences in behaviour for cordgrass-brome vs. cordgrass-mudflat edges have implications for the connectivity of cordgrass patches as well as their persistence. Higher dispersal rates are expected between cordgrass patches separated by brome relative to mudflat, but patches surrounded by mudflat appear more likely to persist through time. 5. The experimental design and diffusion models used here could potentially be extended to any organism where mass mark-recapture experiments are feasible, as well as complex natural landscapes.},

abstract = {We tested for soil substrate effects on the movement and infectivity of naturally co-occurring entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis marelatus, alone and in combination. We manipulated the presence and bulk density of soil and added Galleria mellonella baits within capped and perforated 15mL centrifuge tubes. Sampling tubes were then deployed in situ into field and laboratory settings as experimental traps for infective juveniles. In comparisons with standard soil collections from Lupinus arboreus rhizospheres, sampling tubes were equally sensitive to the presence of H. marelatus and more sensitive to S. feltiae. In laboratory microcosms, both EPN species infected Galleria at high frequencies in tubes lacking soil and in the absence of heterospecifics. Infection frequency of S. feltiae was unaffected by the presence of H. marelatus, but it declined with higher soil bulk density inside tubes. In contrast, detectable infection frequency by H. marelatus was reduced only marginally by the presence of soil but severely by the presence of S. feltiae. Thus, the presence of soil in tubes reversed the identity of dominant species infecting Galleria in tubes, an effect magnified when soils were compacted. Moreover, S. feltiae rarely moved into tubes lacking Galleria baits, whereas H. marelatus colonized unbaited tubes 4- to 5-fold more frequently than S. feltiae. In situ, sampling tubes acted as filters to reduce interference and contamination by fungal pathogens common in field soils. The method allows precision sampling with minimal soil disturbance while protecting bait insects from scavengers. Manipulation of tube design may allow selective sampling of EPN species, depending on the abiotic characteristics of soils, and the biology, behavior, and interspecific interactions of coexisting species.},

abstract = {Global climate change is frequently considered a major conservation threat. The Earth's climate has already warmed by 0.5 degrees C over the past century, and recent studies show that it is possible to detect the effects of a changing climate on ecological systems. This suggests that global change may be a current and future conservation threat. Changes in recent decades are apparent at all levels of ecological organizations: population and life-history changes, shifts in geographic range, changes in species composition of communities, and changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. These ecological effects can be linked to recent population declines adn to both local and global extinctions of species. Although it is impossible to prove that climate change is the cause of these ecological effects, these findings have important implications for conservation biology. It is no longer safe to assume that all of a species' historic range remains suitable. In drawing attention to the importance of climate change as a current threat to species, these studies emphasize the need for current conservation efforts to consider climate change in both in situ conservation and reintroduction efforts. Additional threats will emerge as climate continues to change, especially as climate interacts with other stressors such as habitat fragmentation. These studies can contribute to preparations for future challenges by providing valuable input to models and direct examples of how species respond to climate change.},

abstract = {Parasites occur in nearly every population. They often interact in complex ways with other stressors. In some cases, the interaction may lead to a disproportionately negative effect on the host population. In other cases, the stressor may ameliorate the effects of parasitism. Here we illustrate intersections of four types of environmental stressors with infectious diseases. First, pollutants may increase parasitism by increasing host susceptibility or by increasing the abundance of intermediate hosts and vectors. Pollutants can also decrease parasitism if infected hosts suffer differentially high mortality, parasites are more susceptible to pollution than their hosts, or if pollutants negatively affect intermediate hosts or vectors. These effects vary depending on the particular parasite and pollutant that interact. Second, habitat alterations such as impounding water or development can affect both intermediate host and vector populations such that the abundance of their attendant parasites is either increased or reduced. Third, fisheries can impact populations already stressed by disease. However, they may act to lower the density of a host population below the threshold for sustained transmission to such an extent that the parasite population can no longer persist. Fourth, introduced species may introduce new diseases to susceptible native populations or they may gain an advantage if they invade without the parasites from their native range. The complexity and ubiquity of these interactions are good arguments for considering parasitism when evaluating stressors of aquatic systems.},

abstract = {Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are parasitized by the protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha throughout their geographical range. Monarchs inhabiting seasonally fluctuating environments migrate annually, and parasite prevalence is lower among migratory relative to non-migratory populations. One explanation for this pattern is that long-distance migration weeds out infected animals, thus reducing parasite prevalence and transmission between generations. In this study we experimentally infected monarchs from a migratory population and recorded their long-distance flight performance using a tethered flight mill. Results showed that parasitized butterflies exhibited shorter flight distances, slower flight speeds, and lost proportionately more body mass per km flown. Differences between parasitized and unparasitized monarchs were generally not explained by individual variation in wing size, shape, or wing loading, suggesting that poorer flight performance among parasitized hosts was not directly caused by morphological constraints. Effects of parasite infection on powered flight support a role for long-distance migration in dramatically reducing parasite prevalence in this and other host-pathogen systems.},

abstract = {1. The distribution of dispersal distances (the dispersal kernel) is a major determinant of spatial population dynamics, yet little is known about the shape of the dispersal kernel for most species. This is partly because of the relative difficulty of measuring dispersal, exacerbated by a lack of standardized protocols. We suggest that this problem can be addressed by using modelling approaches to aid the design of studies to quantify dispersal. 2. In this study we present such an approach by optimizing seed trap sampling design using stochastic simulations. A number of alternative sampling designs (random placements, grid arrays, transects, sectors and annuli arrangements) for a point source were tested against a common kernel to assess the best methods for estimating the dispersal kernel. 3. For a given source strength and total trap area, transects and sectors of traps usually provided better data for kernel estimation than random placement, grid arrays and annuli. Kernel estimation was improved by increasing the source strength (the number of dispersing propagules) and the trap area, as expected. 4. When the 'true' kernel was unknown, transects were slightly better for identifying the thin-tailed exponential distribution, whereas sectors were better for detecting the fat-tailed half-Cauchy. 5. In the case of anisotropic dispersal (here, dispersal biased in one direction), annuli and grid arrays performed better than transects and sectors when the anisotropy was unknown. However, when the anisotropy was anticipated, and the trap arrangements were adjusted accordingly, transects and sectors were better. This was true regardless of source strength and total trap area. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a simulation approach to the design of dispersal experiments. While the general results of our simulations can be used by those designing field studies for plant point sources, the simulation approach itself can be modified for a wide range of organisms, dispersal mechanisms and dispersal measurement approaches. Thus, the approach presented here facilitates improvements of dispersal study designs, which in turn will increase the precision of dispersal kernel estimates and predictions of spatial population dynamics, including modelling of rates of spread or metapopulations. This is invaluable in a range of ecological applications, such as the management of rare or invasive species, predicting species' response to climate change, or planning species reintroductions.},

abstract = {1 Host-pathogen interactions in isolated populations may result in the adaptation of pathogens to local hosts. However, results of earlier studies of local adaptation in plant-pathogen systems have been contradictory and it has been suggested that specific, species characteristics, for example distribution, dispersal and the degree of pathogen dependence on the host, are important for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. In addition, the scale of the study may influence whether or not local adaptation is found. 2 We argue that local adaptation of the pathogen to the host can be expected in a system where: (i) the pathogen is host-specific with a short generation time compared with the host; (ii) populations are isolated, allowing localized evolution to occur; and (iii) the study is performed on a geographical scale exceeding the maximum dispersal range of the interacting species. 3 To test these predictions we examined the within- and among-population variation in resistance and virulence of the plant-pathogen system Salix triandra -Melampsora amygdalinae. The pathogen occurs throughout the whole distribution range of the host, and the area of interest consists of highly isolated, small natural populations. 4 Resistance and virulence differed both within and between populations and all clones showed a unique resistance pattern. We conclude that M. amygdalinae is locally adapted to the host S. triandra as all pathogen populations have a higher probability of infecting sympatric than allopatric hosts. Furthermore, high resistance in the host population was accompanied by a high virulence in the pathogen population, suggesting that high resistance levels in a host population may select for more virulent pathogen populations, or vice versa. 5 The nature of host-pathogen interactions differs among systems, and the dynamics of the interaction between S. triandra and M. amygdalinae is governed by characteristics that have resulted in the evolution of local adaptation. 6 Thus, when studying local adaptation of pathogens to their hosts it is important to consider the biology, as well as the scale of dispersal and spatial distribution of both host and pathogen.},

abstract = {Parasitism is the most common animal lifestyle, yet food webs rarely include parasites. The few earlier studies have indicated that including parasites leads to obvious increases in species richness, number of links, and food chain length. A less obvious result was that adding parasites slightly reduced connectance, a key metric considered to affect food web stability. However, reported reductions in connectance after the addition of parasites resulted from an inappropriate calculation. Two alternative corrective approaches applied to four published studies yield an opposite result: parasites increase connectance, sometimes dramatically. In addition, we find that parasites can greatly affect other food web statistics, such as nestedness (asymmetry of interactions), chain length, and linkage density. Furthermore, whereas most food webs find that top trophic levels are least vulnerable to natural enemies, the inclusion of parasites revealed that mid-trophic levels, not low trophic levels, suffered the highest vulnerability to natural enemies. These results show that food webs are very incomplete without parasites. Most notably, recognition of parasite links may have important consequences for ecosystem stability because they can increase connectance and nestedness.},

abstract = {Although Darwin pioneered the study of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of aquatic invertebrates via waterbirds, it remains in its infancy as a modern discipline. A handful of recent studies have quantified internal or external transport in the field, confirming that a variety of long-distance migrants carry invertebrates both internally and externally. These studies show that variation in the morphology of vectors influences the frequency and size of propagules transported, and suggest that more invertebrate groups disperse via birds than was previously thought. Dispersal limitation has mainly been investigated for zooplankton in small experimental systems from which waterbirds were effectively excluded, and the extent of such limitation for invertebrate populations in wetlands interconnected by waterbird movements remains unclear. We expect that the spatial and temporal scales at which dispersal limitation constrains geographical ranges, species richness and genetic structure of invertebrates depends partly on the density of migratory birds using the area. Birds may have a major role in the expansion of exotic species. We propose several avenues for future research. There is a particular need for more quantitative studies of LDD by birds that will enable modellers to assess its role in maintaining invertebrate biodiversity among increasingly fragmented wetlands and in the face of climate change, as well as in the spread of invasive species},

abstract = {Interest in facilitative predator-plant interactions has focused upon above-ground systems. Underground physical conditions are distinctive, however, and we provide evidence that bush lupine, Litpinus arboreits, Facilitates the survival of the predatory nematode Heterorhabditis marelatus. Because H. marelatus is prone to desiccation and lupines maintain a zone of moist soil around their taproots even during dry periods, we hypothesized that dry-season nematode survival under lupines might be higher than in the surrounding grasslands. We performed field surveys and measured nematode survival in lupine and grassland rhizospheres under wet- and dry-season conditions. Nematodes survived the crucial summer period better under lupines than in grasslands; however, this advantage disappeared in wet, winter soils. Modeling the probability of nematode population extinction showed that, while even large nematode cohorts were likely to go extinct in grasslands, even small cohorts in lupine rhizospheres were likely to survive until the arrival of the next prey generation. Because this nematode predator has a strong top-down effect on lupine survival via its effect on root-boring larvae of the ghost moth Hepialus californicus, this facilitative interaction may enable a below-ground trophic cascade. Similar cases of predator facilitation in seasonally stressful environments are probably common in nature.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal analyses of non-epidemic bark beetle populations may provide insight in dynamics predisposing for outbreaks. The present article presents a spatio-temporal analysis of the population dynamics of Ips typographus based on pheromone trap data from southeast and mid-Norway in the post-epidemic period 1979-2002. The analyses include regression analyses, hierarchical cluster analysis, and analysis of spatial synchrony of beetle time series and climatic data by means of nonparametric spatial covariance functions. The mean abundance of beetles declined linearly with latitude. In addition, the time series means were higher in areas with high forest productivity and rocky soils predisposed to drought. The time series patterns differed significantly between northern and southern study areas. The regional synchrony of the time series was fairly high (0.38), indicating that some large-scale climatic factor may influence the dynamics. Windfelling was the external variable showing the most parallel pattern of correlation to the beetle dynamics. We thus posit that large windfall events may be a major instigator and synchronizer of beetle outbreaks in areas subjected to regionalized weather systems.},

abstract = {Some hosts harbor diverse parasite communities, whereas others are relatively parasite free. Many factors have been proposed to account for patterns of parasite species richness, but few studies have investigated competing hypotheses among multiple parasite communities in the same host clade. We used a comparative data set of 941 host-parasite combinations, representing 101 anthropoid primate species and 231 parasite taxa, to test the relative importance of four sets of variables that have been proposed as determinants of parasite community diversity in primates: host body mass and life history, social contact and population density, diet, and habitat diversity. We defined parasites broadly to include not only parasitic helminths and arthropods but also viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, and we controlled for effects of uneven sampling effort on per-host measures of parasite diversity. In nonphylogenetic tests, body mass was correlated with total parasite diversity and the diversity of helminths and viruses. When phylogeny was taken into account, however, body mass became nonsignificant. Host population density, a key determinant of parasite spread in many epidemiological models, was associated consistently with total parasite species richness and the diversity of helminths, protozoa, and viruses tested separately. Geographic range size and day range length explained significant variation in the diversity of viruses.},

abstract = {Cycles in biological populations have been shown to arise from enemy-victim systems, delayed density dependence, and maternal effects. In an initial effort to model the year-to-year dynamics of natural populations of entomopathogenic nematodes and their insect hosts, we find that a simple, nonlinear, mechanistic model produces large amplitude, period two population cycles. The cycles are generated by seasonal dynamics within semi-isolated populations independently of inter-annual feedback in host population numbers, which differs from previously studied mechanisms. The microparasites compete for a fixed number of host insect larvae. Many nematodes at the beginning of the year quickly eliminate the pool of small hosts, and few nematodes are produced for the subsequent year. Conversely, initially small nematode populations do not over-exploit the host population, so the surviving hosts grow to be large and produce many nematodes that survive to the following year.

@article{Ebert2001,
abstract = {Several models have been suggested to explain variation in parasite richness among populations. Most of these models are based on epidemiological factors (population size, number of host species), biological factors (patch quality, interspecific competition) and the spatial and temporal structure of the host metapopulation. We studied the parasites of 137 rock pool populations of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna to determine the factors that account for total parasite richness, richness of endoparasites and epibionts, and the presence/absence patterns of individual parasite species. The rock pools of 86 of these populations have been studied since 1982, and it is known how long these pools have been continuously inhabited by Daphnia. By far the best predictor of total parasite richness was host population age, which explained similar to 50\% of the variance. While endoparasite richness increased linearly with age over 16 yr, epibiont richness saturated similar to3 yr after pool colonization, which may be explained by the higher dispersal rate of epibionts. After we corrected for host population age, endoparasite richness was positively correlated with the water volume of the rock pool (an estimator for host population size), and epibiont richness was correlated with water conductivity. Pools with lower water conductivity (less influenced by the brackish water of the Baltic Sea) had more epibiont species. The local network size of the host metapopulation (local pool density and number of pools per island) hardly influenced parasite richness. There was also no strong indication of spatial effects (isolation by distance and island effects) on the parasite community. The factors that were correlated with species richness were, however, not the same as those related to the presence of single parasite species. At least for certain epibionts, it appears that presence/absence patterns were influenced by interspecific competition. In conclusion, our analysis shows that predictions derived from epidemiological and temporal models, but not from spatial models, can explain parasite richness patterns, despite apparent conflicting patterns found for individual, parasite species. Our analysis extends the scope of these models, which were previously supported mainly with helminths, to bacteria and protozoa.},

abstract = {Infective juveniles (IJs) of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are susceptible to a wide variety of environmental factors, including desiccation, which limit their usefulness as biocontrol agents. Although EPNs can be subjected to a gradual loss of water in their natural environment they are not full anhydrobiotes, being able to survive only moderate levels of desiccation at high relative humidities (rh). We investigated the desiccation tolerance of IJs of several Heterorhabditis species and strains when exposed to fast and slow desiccation regimes. We also investigated the behavioural and biochemical responses of Heterorhabditis IJs when exposed to 98\% rh for 4 days. IJs of H. megidis UK211 (but not IJs of H. indica) aggregate into large clumps when desiccated at high rh, but unlike Steinernema spp., neither H. megidis nor H. indica IJs showed any tendency to coil. Preincubation of H. megidis UK211 IJs at high (98\%) rh enhances their ability to survive for 150 min at 57\% rh. We show that preincubation of H. megidis and H. indica at 98\% rh induces the synthesis of glycerol but not of trehalose, whereas identical preincubation conditions do induce trehalose synthesis in Steinernema carpocapsae and Aphelenchus avenae. The biosynthesis of glycerol rather than trehalose by IJs of two species of Heterorhabditis in response to moderate levels of desiccation indicates that Heterorhabditis is unlikely to have the necessary metabolic responses to desiccation required to enable it to enter into a fully anhydrobiotic state.},

abstract = {Entomopathogenic nematodes and the chloronicotinyl insecticide, imidacloprid, interact synergistically on the mortality of third-instar white grubs (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). The degree of interaction, however, varies with nematode species, being synergistic for Steinernema glaseri (Steiner) and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar, but only additive for Steinernema kushidai Mamiya. The mechanism of the interaction between imidacloprid and these three entomopathogenic nematodes was studied in the laboratory. In vials with soil and grass, mortality, speed of kill, and nematode establishment were negatively affected by imidacloprid with S. kushidai but positively affected with S. glaseri and H. bacteriophora. In all other experiments, imidacloprid had a similar effect for all three nematode species on various factors important for the successful nematode infection in white grubs. Nematode attraction to grubs was not affected by imidacloprid treatment of the grubs. Establishment of intra-hemocoelically injected nematodes was always higher in imidacloprid-treated grubs but the differences were small and in most cases not significant. The major factor responsible for synergistic interactions between imidacloprid and entomopathogenic nematodes appears to be the general disruption of normal nerve function due to imidacloprid resulting in drastically reduced activity of the grubs. This sluggishness facilitates host attachment of infective juvenile nematodes. Grooming and evasive behavior in response to nematode attack was also reduced in imidacloprid-treated grubs. The degree to which different white grub species responded to entomopathogenic nematode attack varied considerably. Untreated Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) grubs were the most responsive to nematode attack among the species tested. Untreated Cyclocephala borealis Arrow (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) grubs showed a weaker grooming and no evasion response, and untreated C. hirta LeConte (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) grubs showed no significant response. Chewing/biting behavior was significantly increased in the presence of nematodes in untreated P. japonica and C. borealis but not in C. hirta and imidacloprid-treated P. japonica and C. borealis. Our observations, however, did not provide an explanation for the lack of synergism between imidacloprid and S. kushidai.},

The efficacy was tested against the oriental beetle, Exomala (= Anomala) orientalis, the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica, and the northern masked chafer, Cyclocephala borealis, under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions, and against the European chafer, Rhizotrogus majalis, in the laboratory. Under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, S. scarabaei was highly pathogenic to P. japonica, E. orientalis, and R. majalis, but was less effective against C borealis. However, S. scarabaei provided excellent control of P. japonica, E. orientalis, and C borealis under field conditions. P. japonica was the most nematode-susceptible white grub species. Against this species the superiority of S. scarabaei over the other nematodes tested became only apparent under field conditions and with very low nematode rates in the laboratory. C borealis was less susceptible to all nematodes tested and only in a field experiment did S. scarabaei clearly outperform H. bacteriophora. Both E. orientalis and R. majalis were highly susceptible to S. scarabaei but showed moderate to low susceptibility to all other nematodes tested. In a, field experiment, S. scarabaei also controlled P. japonica and E orientalis larvae more quickly than H. bacteriophora. There was weak synergism between S. scarabaei and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid against E. orientalis larvae but not against P. japonica and C borealis larvae.

abstract = {Detailed analyses of thresholded ecological interactions call improve Our understanding of the transition from aperiodic to periodic dynamics. We develop a threshold model of the population dynamics of outbreaking bark beetle populations that alternate between non-epidemic and epidemic behavior. The model involves accumulation of resources during low-density periods and depletion during outbreaks. The transition between the two regimes is caused by disturbance events in the form of major tree felling by wind. The model is analyzed with particular reference to the population dynamics of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) in Scandinavia for which a comprehensive literature allows full parameterization, The fairly constant outbreak lengths and the highly variable waiting time between Outbreaks that are-seen in the historical records of this species agree well with the predictions of the model. The thresholded resource-depletion dynamics result in substantial variation in the degree of periodicity between stochastic realizations. The completely aperiodic tree colonizations are partly predictable when the timing of the irregular windfall events are known. However, the predictability of inter-outbreak periods is low due to the large variation of cases falling most frequently in the middle between the extremes of purely nonperiodic (erratic) and periodic (Cyclic) fluctuations.},

We conducted experiments using C, hirta in California and P, japonica in New Jersey. A field trial conducted in 2 different California turfgrass sites compared the field persistence in the absence of hosts of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner subspecies japonensis Buibui strain, the milky disease bacterium, Paenibacillus (=Bacillus) popilliae (Dutky), and the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema kushidai Mamiya and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar to that of the organophosphate diazinon. Soil samples taken 0-70 d after applications were bio-assayed with P, japonica. Only diazinon and the entomopathogenic nematode S. kushidai caused substantial mortality and S. kushidai activity persisted significantly longer than diazinon activity. In greenhouse experiments, combinations of entomopathogenic nematode species usually resulted in additive mortality of scarab larvae. Combinations of S, kushidai and diazinon also resulted in additive mortality. In field trials, the efficacy of H. bacteriophora and especially S. kushidai and S. glaseri, was comparable to that of diazinon over 14-18 d. However, it is likely that at least S. kushidai would have outperformed diazinon over an extended period because of its longer persistence and potential for recycling in the hosts. S. kushidai, should it become commercially available, deserves further examination as an alternative to chemical white grub control especially as a highly compatible component of sustainable turfgrass management.},

abstract = {The introduction of chronic, infectious diseases by colonizing populations (invasive or reintroduced) is a serious hazard in conservation biology, threatening the original host and other spillover species. Most research on spatial invasion of diseases has pertained to established host populations, either at steady, state or fluctuating through time. Within a colonizing population, however, the spread of disease may be influenced by the expansion process of the Population itself. Here we explore the simultaneous expansion of a colonizing population and a chronic, nonlethal disease introduced with it, describing basic patterns in homogeneous and structured landscapes and discussing implications for disease management. We describe expected outcomes of such introductions for three qualitatively distinct cases, depending on the relative velocities at which the population and epidemic expand. (1) If transmissibility is low the disease cannot be sustained, although it may first expand its range somewhat around the point of introduction. (2) If transmissibility is moderate but the wave-front velocity for the population; v(p,) is higher than that for the disease, v(d), the disease wave front lags behind that of the Population. (3) A highly transmissible disease, with v(d) > v(p), will invade sufficiently rapidly to track the spread of the host. To test these elementary theoretical predictions, we Simulated disease outbreaks in a spatially structured host population occupying a real landscape. We used a spatially explicit, individual-based model of Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) reintroduced in northern Israel, considering a hypothetical introduction of bovine tuberculosis. Basic patterns of disease expansion in this realistic setting were similar to our conceptual predictions for homogeneous landscapes. Landscape heterogeneity, however, induced the establishment of population activity centers and disease foci within them, leading to jagged wave fronts and causing local variation in the relative velocities at which the population and epidemic expanded. Based on predictions from simple theory and simulations of managed outbreaks, we suggest that the relative velocities at which the population and epidemic expand have important implications for the impact of different management strategies. Recognizing which of our three general cases best describes a particular outbreak will aid in planning an efficient strategy to contain the disease.},

Metapopulations are assemblages of local populations in which the whole (metapopulation) may persist even if all the components (local populations) are vulnerable to extinction. Patterns of habitat patch occupancy and local density in the three species support the general predictions of metapopulation models. We develop a spatially explicit metapopulation model and fit it to data on the three species. The model is tested with independent data on H. comma and P. argus, for which it predicts the rate and pattern of spread into networks of vacant habitat patches following introduction or natural recolonization. The model can be used to assess the potential of specific networks of habitat patches to support viable metapopulations of given species, and it therefore has great potential value for conservation of butterflies and other species which occur as systems of interconnected small populations.},

abstract = {In May 2002, studies on the seasonal patterns of nematode infection of sheep were undertaken on four commercial sheep farms in southern Sweden, which had previously reported problems with nematode parasitism, especially due to Haemonchus contortus. One farm was used for intensive investigation. This entailed the establishment of two replicate groups of sheep, each consisting of 20 ewes and their lambs, on adjacent pasture paddocks. The seasonal patterns of nematode infection were followed by regular (approximately monthly) sampling of both ewes and lambs for nematode faecal egg counts and larval differentiation, and the sequential use of replicate groups of tracer lambs. H. contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta were the most abundant nematode species, with the former most prevalent in the post-parturient faecal egg counts of ewes. Tracer worm counts showed almost 100\% arrested development in the early fourth larval stage for H. contortus as early as mid-summer and the numbers of parasites progressively increased during the season. T. circumcincta also showed high levels of arrested development, but not as early, or as absolute, as for H. contortus. Tracers allocated to the paddocks at the time of turn-out following winter in May 2003, showed virtually a total absence of H. contortus in contrast to exceedingly high infections with T. circumcincta. Results of the three additional monitoring flocks supported these findings. It can be concluded that under Swedish sheep farming conditions, H. contortus has evolved to survive the long, cold winters entirely within the host as the arrested larval stage, relying on the lambing ewe to complete its life cycle. The peri-parturient relaxation of resistance in the ewes triggers the resumption of development to the adult egg-laying parasites to result in pasture contamination and the completion of just one parasite generation/year. In contrast, T. circumcincta can survive well over-winter, both on pasture and within the host. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Detailed information on the dispersal of adult butterflies among this same set of populations was available. Simple and partial Mantel tests were used to examine the relationships between genetic distances, predicted rates of dispersal, and a number of landscape variables, all measured pairwise for 17 sample sites. Nei's standard genetic distance was negatively correlated with predicted dispersal. We observed a significant pattern of isolation by distance at a very small spatial scale. The distance between sites that was through forest was a stronger predictor of genetic distance than the distance through open meadow, indicating a significant effect of landscape on population genetic structure beyond that of simple isolation by distance. Our results suggest that rises in the tree-line in alpine areas, caused by global warming, will lead to reduced gene flow among populations of P. smintheus.},

abstract = {For a species to colonize a site it must both arrive there by dispersal from another site and maintain positive population growth in the local environment. I experimentally tested the role of dispersal limitation in structuring the zooplankton communities of fishless ponds in southwestern Michigan. An average of 12.9 new species of rotifers and crustaceans from the region were introduced at the beginning of the experiment into the intact resident communities of seven ponds in large in situ enclosures (the invasion treatment). Introduced species were found at least once over three months in six of the seven ponds, and one species consistently colonized all three replicate: enclosures in three of the ponds. However, the success rate of the introductions was low as >91\% of the species introduced immediately became extinct. In addition, introduced species remained rare throughout the experiment in every pond, comprising only 0-2.5\% of total zooplankton community biomass. No effects of the invasion treatment were detected on total zooplankton diversity or biomass, on the biomass of native species, or on chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting that relaxing dispersal limitation for the regional pool had minimal effects on local community structure. Both the biomass of exotic species and the proportion of species introduced that successfully colonized the invasion treatment were negatively correlated with native species diversity. These patterns support the hypothesis that diversity confers resistance to invasion. The results of the invasion treatment indicated a minor role for dispersal limitation in structuring pond zooplankton communities. To test the role of interactions with resident species in excluding potential invaders, a second experiment was performed in four different ponds the following year. In addition to the control and invasion treatment, a second treatment (the resistance treatment) was imposed where the abundance of native species was reduced by filtering before the introduction of invaders. The goal of this treatment was to weaken interactions between resident species and invaders while maintaining the abiotic environment intact. Among the four ponds, 3.8 times more exotic species were found in the resistance treatment than in the invasion treatment, and their total biomass was 16.4 times greater. The contrast between the invasion and resistance treatments indicated an important role for species interactions in repelling invaders. The two experiments showed that zooplankton communities were nearly saturated with species and that biotic interactions excluded many potential invaders.},

The method is illustrated with 3 separate data sets on parasite communities of conspecific fish from different lakes. In 2 of 3 cases, geographical distances among lakes had a significant influence on the similarity of their parasite communities. The effect of geographical distance on species richness of parasite communities also proved important in 2 of the 3 case studies.

abstract = {In previous laboratory studies, entomopathogenic nematodes and Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies japonensis (Btj) caused additive or synergistic mortality in third-instar Cyclocephala (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) grubs when the nematodes were applied at least 7 days after Btj. This type of mortality was observed for C. hirta, a species that is not very susceptible to Btj, and for C. pasadenae, a species that has intermediate susceptibility to Btj. In the present study, this observation was confirmed for third-instar Anomala orientalis, a species that is highly susceptible to Btj. In greenhouse and field studies, additive or synergistic interactions between nematodes and Btj were observed for all three scarab species. The interactions were variable, and to achieve acceptable grub control, high concentrations of Btj had to be applied. A subsequent greenhouse experiment showed that young third-instar C. pasadenae were more susceptible to Btj than older third instars. In addition the interaction between nematodes and Btj was also more synergistic in the younger than in the older third instars. In a field test against a population of C. hirta consisting of late second and early third instars, combinations of nematodes and Btj at economic application rates provided acceptable control levels whether applied simultaneously or with a 4-day delay between Btj and nematode application. Our observations suggest that curative control of white grubs is possible with combinations of entomopathogenic nematodes and Btj if the applications are done when populations consist of second and early third instars.

The most critical periods for survival are the first few minutes and hours directly after application. High losses, in the order of 40-80\%, often occur during this phase. Ultraviolet radiation and dehydration are probably the most important mortality factors. The remaining nematodes settle in the soil and their numbers gradually decrease at levels of 5-10\% per day. Predation, infection by antagonists, depletion of energy and desiccation are probably the main mortality factors during this period. In most cases, after 2-6 weeks less than 1\% of the applied population is still alive. Through recycling in host insects, nematodes may then persist for years at these levels. Thus, the pattern is a rapid decline in the first Sew clays followed by a moderate decline over the next 2-6 weeks and then a long period of recycling at a low level. Some nematode species that normally occur in warmer climatic zones can also persist in colder climates. Major side-effects of applications of entomopathogenic nematodes are not likely to occur as the population density decreases to background levels within days or weeks after application. Furthermore, there is little or no migration of the nematodes to neighbouring fields. The relatively short period of persistence of entomopathogenic nematodes and the necessity of their populations to recycle frequently in hosts in order to survive make if unlikely that they could have major effects on non-target organisms. Their selectivity and beneficial traits as biological control agents outweigh the small risks of causing unwanted environmental disturbance in non-target populations.},

abstract = {Communities of coexisting organisms are formed by both dispersal among habitat patches in a region and local interactions within patches. The supply of colonists from the regional pool has the potential to alter the outcome of local interactions by providing species that fill different ecological roles. I examined the consequences of invasion by fish (juvenile Lepomis macrochirus) and insect (Notonecta undulata) predators on experimental plankton communities that were either connected to or isolated from the regional pool of zooplankton species. The effects of predators on zooplankton composition and diversity depended on dispersal by members of the regional zooplankton species pool. Fish and notonectids reduced the abundance of large zooplankton and thereby facilitated invasion by new species from the surrounding region. Both predators reduced zooplankton species richness in the absence of dispersal, while fish had positive effects and notonectids had no effects with rapid dispersal. Fish facilitated invasion by more species than they excluded, while similar numbers of species invaded with notonectids as were driven extinct. The effects of predators on planktonic trophic structure (zooplankton size structure and biomass. phytoplankton biomass) were independent of the level of dispersal. Both predators reduced zooplankton mean body size, but only fish enhanced phytoplankton density. Invasion by members of the regional species pool slightly increased zooplankton mean body size and reduced phytoplankton biomass however, the effects were small and independent of the predator treatment. Predator-facilitated invasion of new species altered the effects of predators on zooplankton species composition and diversity, but not on plankton trophic structure. The results suggest that spatial heterogeneity in predator abundance promotes regional coexistence among zooplankton. Connection to a diverse regional species pool via dispersal may therefore be important for determining the impact of local interactions such as predation on communities},

abstract = {Spatial structure is of central importance in the dynamics of plant-parasite interactions and is imposed by the growth habit and distribution of host plants and by parasite dispersal which is frequently restricted. To investigate the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the dynamics of plant parasites we introduce a simple model for epidemic development within a spatially structured host population. Here the host population is subdivided into a number of patches which are linked to allow for transmission from one patch to another with the connections defining the spatial structure of the host population. Three key parameters are identified that play a critical role in the ability of the parasite to invade and persist within the host population: the within-patch parasite basic reproductive number which characterises the infection dynamics at the local spatial scale: and the neighbourhood of interaction which describes which patches interact with which and the strength of coupling between patches within the neighbourhood which together characterise the spread of the parasite over larger spatial scales. Using both deterministic and stochastic formulations of the model, we investigate how the thresholds and probabilities of invasion and persistence are affected by these parameters, by demographic stochasticity and by differences in the initial level of infection.},

The difference among the treatments was non-significant. DBM mortality in the treatments showed a slight increase with increasing temperatures between years. The infectivity of Us on DBM larvae increased with increasing U concentration.

Here we use a stochastic metapopulation model for the transmission of infection in a spatially structured host population. There are three qualitatively different regimes for the extinction time, which depend on patch population size, the within-patch basic reproductive number and the strength of coupling between patches. In the first regime, the extinction time for the metapopulation (i.e. from all patches) is approximately equal to the extinction time for a single patch. In the second regime, the metapopulation extinction time is maximal but also highly variable. In the third regime, the extinction time for the metapopulation (T-E) is given by T-E = a + bn(1/2) where a is the local extinction time (i.e. from last patch), b is the transit time (i.e. the time taken for infection to spread from one patch to another) and n is the total number of patches.},

Their host-finding abilities are poorly understood, despite the fact that these abilities are fundamental to their success as biocontrol agents in soil. Like the vast numbers of exotic hymenopterans and other natural enemies that have been released for biological control over the past century, they may be used in their ecologically competent wild-type form.

abstract = {Habitat loss and the resultant fragmentation of remaining habitat is the primary cause of loss of biological diversity. How do these processes affect the dynamics of parasites and pathogens? Hess has provided some important insights into this problem using metapopulation models for pathogens that exhibit 'S-I' dynamics; for example, pathogens such as rabies in which the host population may be divided into susceptible and infected individuals. A major assumption of Hess's models is that infected patches become extinct, rather than recovering and becoming resistant to future infections. In this paper, we build upon this framework in two different ways: first, we examine the consequences of including patches that are resistant to infection; second, we examine the consequences of including a second species of host that can act as a reservoir for the pathogen. Both of these effects are likely to be important from a conservation perspective. The results of both sets of analysis indicate that the benefits of corridors and other connections that allow species to disperse through the landscape far outweigh the possible risks of increased pathogen transmission. Even in the commonest case, where harmful pathogens are maintained by a common reservoir host, increased landscape connectance still allows greater coexistence and persistence of a threatened or endangered host.},

Previous research showed that S. carpocapsae infective juveniles respond to host cues in a hierarchical order, with attraction to Galleria mellonella volatiles being stimulated by contact with G. mellonella cuticle. We measured host recognition behaviour by calculating the percentage response of S. carpocapsae infective juveniles to volatiles produced by C. mellonella last instars after the nematodes were exposed to the cuticle of 11 candidate arthropod hosts and 2 control surfaces. Host suitability was measured by nematode-induced mortality to candidate hosts at 2 nematode doses and the level of reproduction supported by each host. The highest recognition response was scored for Agrotis ipsilon (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). This insect also incurred nearly 100\% mortality due to nematode infection and supported the highest level of reproduction. Non-insect arthropods tested (Chilopoda and Isopoda) stimulated no behavioural response and were not susceptible to nematode infection. Other insect species elicited intermediate levels of the recognition response. There were significant correlations between behavioural response and nematode-induced mortality at the lower dose. The level of reproduction supported by the candidate hosts was also correlated with S. carpocapsae behavioural response.},

Distinguishing between these behavioral and environmental causes of pattern is of general interest to spatial ecologists and continues to be a key unresolved issue. Despite the importance of this problem, systematic approaches for resolving the underlying mechanisms are not well developed. We demonstrate here the value of a three-tiered systematic approach involving descriptive spatial sampling, individual-based observation and diffusion modeling, and manipulative field experiments. We used this approach to test social- vs. habitat-driven hypotheses explaining spatial aggregation in the collembolan Orchesella hexfasciata. Our results show that aggregation is a gregarious behavior triggered by seasonal increases in soil moisture. Initial field observations suggested that aggregation was habitat driven and associated with soil moisture, but individual-based observations and modeling revealed that Moisture was only a triggering mechanism for socially driven aggregation. This was corroborated in field experiments by testing hypotheses that were motivated by the individual-based analyses. Thus, the three-tiered approach led to a more complete understanding of aggregation than would any single technique.},

Limited area restricts the fauna of small (0.25 to 0.9 hectare) islands to predators of invertebrates (birds, lizards, anurans, and spiders), seed predators (rodents), and herbivores (howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants). Predators of vertebrates are absent, and densities of rodents, howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants are 10 to 100 times greater than on the nearby mainland, suggesting that predators normally Limit their populations. The densities of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees are severely reduced on herbivore-affected islands, providing evidence of a trophic cascade unleashed in the absence of top-down regulation.},

abstract = {Explanations for the ubiquitous presence of spatially synchronous population dynamics have assumed that density-dependent processes governing the dynamics of local populations are identical among disjunct populations, and low levels of dispersal or small amounts of regionalized stochasticity ("Moran effect") can act to synchronize populations. In this study we used historical spatially referenced data on gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) outbreaks to document that density-dependent processes can vary substantially across geographical landscapes. This variation may be due in part to geographical variation in habitat (e.g., variation in forest composition). We then used a second-order log-linear stochastic model to explore how inter-population variation in density-dependent processes affects synchronization via either synchronous stochastic forcing or dispersal. We found that geographical variation in direct density-dependence (first order) greatly diminishes synchrony caused by stochasticity but only slightly decreases synchronization via dispersal. Variation in delayed density-dependence (second order) diluted synchrony caused by regional stochasticity to a lesser extent than first-order variation, but it did not have any influence on synchrony caused by dispersal. In general, synchronization caused by dispersal was primarily dependent upon the instability of populations and only weakly, if at all, affected by similarities in density-dependence among populations. We conclude that studies of synchrony should carefully consider both the nature of the synchronizing agents and the pattern of local density-dependent processes, including how these vary geographically.},

In spite of these increases, it is unclear how effective these nematophagous fungi are in suppressing nematodes. We measured nematode mortality in microcosms with small numbers of assay nematodes, and we examined assay nematodes recovered at the end of the experiment for signs of fungal parasites. Because the microcosms did not have a moat or other refuge, the assay nematodes remained vulnerable for the 3 days that they were in the soil. Mortality in this experiment was not substantially increased compared to a previous experiment, which measured the mortality of a larger number of assay nematodes in microcosms surrounded by a moat. Mortality, however, increased from 34 to 50\% when recovered assay nematodes were examined and when those with conidia of the nematophagous fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis were considered dead. The zoosporic fungus M. glutinospora was not detected, perhaps because the soil water potential was too low. Contrary to our expectations, there was no evidence of negative feedback on nematodes (i.e., no evidence of density-dependent mortality) because the addition of dead moth larvae greatly increased numbers of resident nematodes and A. oligospora but did not greatly affect the probability of nematode mortality.},

abstract = {Parasites exploit an inherently patchy resource, their hosts, which are discrete entities that may only be available for infection within a relatively short time window. However, there has been little consideration of how heterogeneities in host availability may affect the phenotypic or genotypic composition of parasite populations or how parasites may evolve to cope with them. Here we conduct a selection experiment involving an entomopathogenic nematode (Steinernema feltiae) and show for the first time that the infection rate of a parasite can evolve rapidly to maximize the chances of infecting within an environment characterized by the rate of host availability. Furthermore, we show that the parasite's infection rate trades off with other fitness traits, such as fecundity and survival. Crucially, the outcome of competition between strains with different infection strategies depends on the rate of host availability; frequently available hosts favor "fast" infecting nematodes, whereas infrequently available hosts favor "slow" infecting nematodes. A simple evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) analysis based on classic epidemiological models fails to capture this behavior, predicting instead that the fastest infecting phenotype should always dominate. However, a novel model incorporating more realistic, discrete bouts of host availability shows that strain coexistence is highly likely. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneities in host availability play a key role in the evolution of parasite life-history traits and in the maintenance of phenotypic variability. Parasite life-history strategies are likely to evolve rapidly in response to changes in host availability induced by disease management programs or by natural dynamics in host abundance. Incorporating parasite evolution in response to host availability would therefore enhance the predictive ability of current epidemiological models of infectious disease.},

abstract = {1. Using data on breeding birds from a 35-year study of Florida scrub-jays Aphelocoma coerulescens (Bosc 1795), we show that survival probabilities are structured by age, birth cohort, and maternal family, but not by sex. Using both accelerated failure time (AFT) and Cox proportional hazard models, the data are best described by models incorporating variation among birth cohorts and greater mortality hazard with increasing age. AFT models using Weibull distributions with the shape parameter > 1 were always the best-fitting models. 2. Shared frailty models allowing for family structure greatly reduce model deviance. The best-fitting models included a term for frailty shared by maternal families. 3. To ask how long a data set must be to reach qualitatively the same conclusions, we repeated the analyses for all possible truncated data sets of 2 years in length or greater. Length of the data set affects the parameter estimates, but not the qualitative conclusions. In all but three of 337 truncated data sets the best-fitting models pointed to same conclusions as the full data set. Shared frailty models appear to be quite robust. 4. The data are not adequate for testing hypotheses as to whether variation in frailty is heritable. 5. Substantial structured heterogeneity for survival exists in this population. Such structured heterogeneity has been shown to have substantial effects in reducing demographic stochasticity.},

abstract = {Spatially heterogeneous environments can theoretically promote more stable coexistence of hosts and parasites by reducing the risk of parasite attack either through providing permanent spatial refuges or through providing ephemeral refuges by reducing dispersal. In experimental populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the bacteriophage PP7, spatial heterogeneity promoted stable coexistence of host and parasite, while coexistence was significantly less stable in the homogeneous environment. Phage populations were found to be persisting on subpopulations of sensitive bacteria. Transferring populations to fresh microcosms every 24 h prevented the development of permanent spatial refuges. However, the lower dispersal rates in the heterogeneous environment were found to reduce parasite transmission thereby creating ephemeral refuges from phage attack. These results suggest that spatial heterogeneity can stabilize an otherwise unstable host-parasite interaction even in the absence of permanent spatial refuges.},

In previous studies with shrubland soil, Arthrobotrys oligospora was the most common fungus, followed by Monacrosporium eudermatum and Geniculifera paucispora, and all three fungi suppressed H. hepialus when tested individually in soil microcosms. Because shrubland soil usually contained multiple species of nematode-trapping fungi, and especially A. oligospora, we quantified nematode suppression by combinations of A. oligospora and G. paucispora or M. eudermatum. Fungi were added in the form of fungal-colonized nematodes to pasteurized soil, and nematode suppression was measured by comparing nematode invasion of wax moth larvae. Suppression of H. hepialus tended to be less in mixed treatments with A. oligospora than in treatments with G. paucispora or M. eudermatum alone. Population densities of M. eudermatum and G. paucispora were less in the presence than in the absence of A. oligospora. In contrast, A. oligospora population density was unaffected or possibly enhanced by the other fungi.},

abstract = {In theory, predator-prey pairs with extinction-prone local populations can persist through metapopulation dynamics, wherein local populations fluctuate asynchronously, occasionally providing dispersers that prevent permanent extinction in all patches. A few studies have shown that spatial structure can extend predator-prey persistence. However, no studies have unequivocally demonstrated the asynchrony among patches, low dispersal rates, and rescue effects that prove metapopulation dynamics extend persistence. We used a protist predator-prey pair to show that spatial subdivision lengthens persistence through metapopulation dynamics. The pair comprised the predaceous ciliate, Didinium nasutum, feeding on the bacterivorous ciliate, Colpidium cf. striatum. A replicated experiment assessed how habitat subdivision affects persistence. Undivided habitats were of four volumes: 30, 180, 270, and 750 mt. Subdivided microcosms, or ''arrays,'' were groups of nine or 25 linked 30-mL bottles (270 or 750 mt total volume). In arrays, predators and prey persisted for 130 d (602 prey and 437 predator generations), at which point the experiment ended. Predators went extinct in undivided microcosms of equivalent volumes within a mean of only 70 d. Predators persisted for a mean of just 19 d in isolated 30-mL bottles (equivalent to isolated patches of arrays). In a separate experiment, prey were driven extinct in four of 15 isolated 30-mL bottles, and persistence times of predators were broadly similar. We documented the following hallmarks of metapopulation dynamics: (1) asynchronous fluctuations in different subpopulations; (2) frequent local prey extinctions and recolonizations; (3) persistence of protists in arrays, despite extinction of isolated local populations; and (4) rescue effects in predator populations. Other experiments measured dispersal rates and the effects on local dynamics of immigrant predators and prey, and initial predator : prey ratios. Only a small fraction of protists dispersed within a generation, consistent with metapopulation dynamics. Immigration of predators increased the frequency of local extinctions of prey, and immigration of prey increased the persistence of both predators and prey. Higher initial predator:prey ratios decreased the persistence of prey in undivided volumes. Although the pair persisted regionally in arrays, data indicated that local extinctions of prey were common. In array patches, predator:prey ratios were higher and predator-prey cycles were shorter than in undivided volumes. Dispersal made local dynamics more prone to extinction, yet promoted regional persistence because the risk of extinction of distant subpopulations became independent.},

abstract = {We describe the spatial and temporal patterns in the abundance of nematode-trapping fungi and in suppression of nematodes in a coastal shrubland. A previous study at this location (Bodega Marine Reserve, Sonoma County, California) had documented a soil food chain in which an insect-parasitic nematode consumes and kills the soil-dwelling larva of the ghost moth, which otherwise consumes and kills the bush lupine; the patchy distribution of the nematode and lupine suggest the involvement of nematophagous organisms, including nematode-trapping fungi. To test our model (trapping fungi kill insect-parasitic nematodes, and therefore ghost moths persist and kill lupines at some sites), we hypothesized that sites with substantial lupine mortality would contain larger numbers of nematode-trapping fungi and would be more suppressive to nematodes than would sites with little lupine mortality. Soil was collected from eight sites (four with substantial lupine mortality and four with little lupine mortality) at 2-mo intervals for I yr and subjected to dilution plating and most probable number procedures. Nematode-trapping fungi detected were Arthrobotrys brochopaga, A. musiformis, A. oligospora, A. superba, Geniculifera paucispora, Hirsutella rhossiliensis, Monacrosporium cionopagum, M. doedycoides, M. eudermatum, M. parvicollis, Nematoctonus concurrens, and Stylopage sp. A. oligospora was the most abundant. Some soil samples contained large numbers of nematode-trapping fungi (as many as 695 propagules/g of soil), but sites with substantial lupine mortality did not contain larger numbers than did sites with little mortality. In a laboratory bioassay, suppression of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica was significant in 44\% of the samples, but suppression was not correlated with fungal population density; moreover, soil from sites with substantial lupine mortality was less suppressive than was soil from sites with little mortality. The spatial and temporal patterns in fungal abundance and in nematode suppression, therefore, did not support our model that nematode-trapping fungi cause the patchy distribution of the insect-parasitic nematode and hence of lupine. Nevertheless, we must be conservative in rejecting the involvement of these fungi in the food chain, because methods for fungal quantification have important limitations.},

abstract = {Existing and emerging pathogens pose unusual challenges for conservation because of their potential to drive rapid changes in the numerical abundance and genetic composition of wild host populations. An increasing number of studies indicate that host genetic diversity plays an important role in buffering populations against widespread epidemics, and that parasites represent powerful selective agents in natural populations. The observation that infectious diseases might be both mitigated by and rapidly change the genetic composition of host populations gives new significance to the role of host genetic diversity in species conservation. Less clear is the role that pathogen evolutionary change plays in the emergence and spread of new diseases, but recent examples indicate that humans might be selecting unknowingly for rapid changes in pathogen biology through habitat fragmentation, climate shifts and environmental pollution. Although the risks they pose to endangered species are apparent, pathogens and other natural enemies can be a driving force behind species and genetic diversity in natural populations, and preserving interacting networks of coevolving populations should enable hosts to respond better to future disease threats.},

abstract = {1 The metapopulation concept is useful when considering ecological and evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations. However, debate has focused on genetic variation that is neutral rather than under selection. This distinction is particularly important in antagonistic or co-evolutionary interactions such as host-pathogen or predator-prey systems. Plant host-pathogen systems provide some of the best examples of studies in which numerical and genetic dynamics have been investigated in a spatially explicit context, and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. 2 Empirical studies of natural host-pathogen interactions have shown that, while in some cases pathogens appear to be locally adapted to their hosts, in others there is no local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes. Recent theory suggests that the dynamics (epidemic vs. endemic) and migration rates of host and pathogen will be important factors in the maintenance of genetic polymorphisms in resistance and virulence. 3 We argue that the relative spatial scales at which hosts and pathogens interact are crucial to understanding the evolution of resistance/virulence structure. Pathogens that disperse further than their hosts will be more likely to show gene-for-gene interactions than pathogens dispersing over spatial scales similar to or smaller than their hosts. 4 We predict that life-history features that influence encounter rates between specific host and pathogen genotypes will be important factors in determining the evolution of resistance-virulence structures. In particular, we would expect correlative and/or causal relationships between pathogen life-history features [e.g. local vs. systemic infection, type (fecundity vs. mortality) and severity of effects], and whether dynamics are endemic or epidemic. 5 Plant host-pathogen systems provide ideal models for investigating the evolution of non-neutral genetic variation in spatial systems. Understanding the co-evolution of such systems will require research programmes that integrate long-term descriptive and experimental studies of multiple populations, with analytical and computer simulation modelling and comparative/phylogenetic studies.},

abstract = {1 As ectotherms, insects often experience varying temperatures throughout their life cycle, and some respond by becoming more or less melanistic (dark coloring) during development to increase or decrease thermal energy absorption as larvae or adults. 2. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) breed in temperate and tropical environments worldwide and are exposed to different average and extreme temperatures in different parts of their geographic range. In this study, we compared variation in thermally induced melanism among monarch butterflies from eastern and western North America and from South Florida. 3. We raised the progeny of wild-captured adult butterflies from these populations in a common garden experiment, rearing individuals in cold (19 degrees C), moderate (26 degrees C), and hot (32 degrees C) temperatures to examine population variation in larval and adult pigmentation. 4. Across all populations, monarch larvae developed the darkest coloration in the cold treatment and were lightest when reared in hot temperatures. Similar results were observed for measures of adult wing melanism, with the exception of adult females, which developed darker colored wings in warmer temperatures. 5. Significant population-level differences in average measures of melanism among larvae and adult butterflies were observed. Larvae from the eastern population became substantially darker in colder temperatures than S. Florida or western larvae. Western larvae were lightest overall, which might be adaptive to high temperatures experienced throughout portions of their summer breeding range. S. Florida larvae showed a lower response to cold temperatures relative to monarchs from either migratory population. 6. Population level differences were also observed for thermal responses in wing melanism, particularly among adult females. Moreover, we found significant family level effects for each measure of larval and adult melanism, pointing to a genetic basis or strong maternal effects influencing these traits in monarch butterflies.

Utilization of these nematodes is developing rapidly with almost a doubling of newly described species in the past five years. Advances in molecular biology and phylogenetic reconstruction have revolutionized understanding of population structure, identification, genetic improvement, systematics, and the symbiosis between entomopathogenic nematodes and their bacteria. Population structure provides the most fundamental information for reliable identification of species and unique genetic variants. Such information could be further assessed for nematode potential as biological control agents. Phylogenetic reconstruction is an important approach for understanding multitrophic interactions among entomopathogenic nematodes, symbiotic bacteria, and their insect hosts. Phylogenetic reconstruction is also important for the development of a natural and stable type of systematics, which can provide guidelines for selecting appropriate entomopathogenic nematode species for particular biological control programs.},

abstract = {Connectivity is an important but inconsistently defined concept in spatial ecology and conservation biology. Theoreticians from various subdisciplines of ecology argue over its definition and measurement, but no consensus has yet emerged. Despite this disagreement, measuring connectivity is an integral part of many resource management plans. A more practical approach to understanding the many connectivity metrics is needed. Instead of focusing on theoretical issues surrounding the concept of connectivity, we describe a data-dependent framework for classifying these metrics. This framework illustrates the data requirements, spatial scales, and information yields of a range of different connectivity measures. By highlighting the costs and benefits associated with using alternative metrics, this framework allows practitioners to make more informed decisions concerning connectivity measurement},

abstract = {Fitness of tick-borne pathogens may be determined by the degree to which their infection dynamics in vertebrate hosts permits transmission cycles if infective and uninfected tick stages are active at different times of the year. To investigate this hypothesis we developed a simulation model that integrates the transmission pattern imposed by seasonally asynchronous nymphal and larval Ixodes scapularis ticks in northeastern North America, with a model of infection in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) reservoir hosts, using the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum as examples. In simulations, survival of microparasites, their sensitivity to reduced rodent and tick abundance, and to 'dilution' by a reservoir-incompetent host depended on traits that allowed (i) highly efficient transmission from acutely-infected hosts, (ii) long-lived acute or 'carrier' host infections, and/or (iii) transmission amongst co-feeding ticks. Minimum values for transmission efficiency to ticks, and duration of host infectivity, necessary for microparasite persistence, were always higher when nymphal and larval ticks were seasonally asynchronous than when these instars were synchronous. Thus, traits influencing duration of host infectivity, transmission efficiency to ticks and co-feeding transmission are likely to be dominant determinants of fitness in I. scapularis-borne microparasites in northeastern North America due to abiotic forcings influencing I. scapularis seasonality.},

Our model is then augmented with the evolution of virulence to determine coevolutionarily stable strategies of host sociality and pathogen virulence. In contrast to a controversial hypothesis by Ewald (1994), our analysis indicates that pathogens may become more virulent when contact rates are low, and their prevalence can ultimately induce greater sociality.},

The flow of organisms across system boundaries is known to occur between different natural habitats as well as across the crop-noncrop interface. Several studies show how field boundaries can enhance predator populations invading arable crops and controlling pest populations. However, generalist arthropods may also spill over from land-use systems to natural areas (mainly grassland) modifying interactions therein. A view of land-use systems as sources and natural habitats as sinks is consistent with the idea that the direction of the organisms' fluxes is from high to low productivity systems, while noncrop habitats are important sources for recolonization of arable fields after they are cleared for harvest. From the perspective of landscape management, enhancement of population exchanges between crop and noncrop areas may include beneficial as well as unwelcome interactions.},

We used a theoretical framework to study spatiotemporal structuring in a transient natural enemy-victim system subject to differential rates of dispersal, stochastic forcing, and nonlinear dynamics. Highly mobile natural enemies that attacked less mobile victims were locally spatially segregated from each other when governed by approximate linear dynamics. In contrast, in nonlinear dynamical systems, such as cyclic populations, interacting species achieved local aggregation with each other regardless of dispersal rates, and aggregation was enhanced specifically when highly mobile enemies attacked less mobile victims. These patterns of spatial aggregation held under varying levels of stochastic forcing. This work thus shows a range of dynamic spatial patterns in interacting-species models, and how spatial aggregation between natural enemies and victims can be achieved in locally unstable populations that are linked through dispersal.},

abstract = {Biological control manipulations of natural enemies to reduce pest populations represent large-scale ecological experiments that have both benefited from and contributed to various areas of modern ecology. Unfortunately, economic expediency and the need for rapid implementation often require that biological control programs be based more on trial and error than on sound ecological theory and testing. This approach has led to some remarkable successes but it has also produced dismal failures. This point is particularly well illustrated in the historical development and use of entomopathogenic nematodes for the biological control of insect pests. Intense effort has focused on developing these natural enemies as alternatives to chemical insecticides, in part because laboratory assays indicated that these nematodes possess a broad host range. This illusory attribute launched hundreds of field releases, many of which failed due to ecological barriers to infection that are not apparent from laboratory exposures, where conditions are optimal and host-parasite contact assured. For example, the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae is a poor choice to control scarab larvae because this nematode uses an ambusher foraging strategy near the soil surface whereas the equally sedentary scarab remains within the soil profile, shows a weak host recognition response to scarabs, has difficulty overcoming the scarab immune response, and has low reproduction in this host. Conversely, two other nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and S. glaseri, are highly adapted to parasitize scarabs: they use a cruising foraging strategy, respond strongly to scarabs, easily overcome the immune response, and reproduce well in these hosts. Increased understanding of the ecology of entomopathogenic nematodes has enabled better matches between parasites and hosts, and more accurate predictions of field performance. These results underline the importance of a strong partnership between basic and applied ecology in the area of biological control.},

Here, we derive analytical expressions showing that the misestimation for each demographic parameter is exactly (in the case of survival.) or approximately (in the case of fecundity) proportional to the among-individual variance in that parameter. We also show why this misestimation depends on systematic variation among individuals, rather than random variation. These results indicate that correctly assessing the importance of demographic stochasticity requires (1) an estimate of the variance in each demographic parameter; (2) information on the qualitative shape (convex or concave) of the mean-variance relationship; and (3) information on the, mechanisms generating among-individual variation. An important consequence is that almost all population viability analyses (PVAS) overestimate the importance of demographic stochasticity and, therefore, the risk of extinction.},

abstract = {The soils of the Bodega Marine Reserve (BMR, Sonoma County, California) contain many nematode-trapping fungi and many ghost moth larvae parasitized by entomopathogenic nematodes. The current study determined whether these nematode-parasitized moth larvae, which can produce very large numbers of nematodes, enhanced the population densities of nematode-trapping fungi and whether the fungi trapped substantial numbers of nematodes emerging and dispersing from moths. Wax moths were used in place of ghost moths because the former are easier to obtain. When nematode-parasitized moth larvae were added to laboratory microcosms containing BMR field soil, the population densities of four nematode-trapping fungi increased substantially. The greatest increase in population density was by Arthrobotrys oligospora, which uses adhesive networks to capture nematodes. A. oligospora population density increased about 10 times when the added moth larvae were parasitized by the nematode Heterorhabditis marelatus and about 100 times when added moth larvae were parasitized by the nematode Steinernema glaseri. Other trapping fungi endemic to the soil and enhanced by nematode-parasitized moth larvae included Myzocytium glutinosporum, Drechslerella brochopaga, and Gamsylella gephyropaga, which produce adhesive spores, constricting rings, and adhesive branches, respectively. The data suggest that the previously documented abundance and diversity of nematode-trapping fungi in BMR soil can be explained, at least in part, by nematode-parasitized insects, although that inference requires further studies with ghost moths. The strong bottom-up enhancement of nematode-trapping fungi was not matched by a strong top-down suppression of nematodes, i.e. the fungi trapped fewer than 30\% of dispersing nematodes.

abstract = {In previous greenhouse and field studies, the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid interacted synergistically with five entomopathogenic nematode species against five scarab species. Two other neonicotinoids, thiamethoxam and acetamiprid, showed a weaker interaction with nematodes in scarab larvae. Entomopathogenic nematodes have the potential to recycle in hosts after inundative applications, thereby increasing the persistence of nematodes and insect control. Thus we investigated the effect of neonicotinoids on nematode fitness after tank mixing and after combined applications. Tank mixing only had a negative effect on nematode survival and infectivity in a few nematode insecticide combinations and only if both insecticide concentration and exposure time were several times higher than typical for field applications. Combined application of nematodes with imidacloprid generally had no negative effect on the percentage of scarab cadavers producing progeny or the number of nematode progeny emerging per cadaver. In experiments with a synergistic increase in scarab mortality, the total number of progeny in combination treatments was up to four times higher than in nematodes only treatments. Similarly, nematode populations in soil from combination treatments were 13.2 times greater than for nematodes only treatments at 28 days after treatment. Combined imidacloprid-nematode applications did not affect the pathogenicity or infectivity of the nematode progeny. Combining thiamethoxam with nematodes had no negative effects on nematode reproduction in the majority of treatments. However, due to the weaker interaction of thiamethoxam and nematodes on scarab mortality, the total number of nematode progeny per treatment generally did not increase compared with nematodes only treatments. The demonstrated tank mix compatibility of imidacloprid and nematodes improves the feasibility of combining these agents for curative white grub control. The positive effect of imidacloprid on nematode reproduction after combined application may increase the likelihood of infection of white grubs by subsequent generations of nematodes, thereby improving their field persistence and biological control potential.},

Seasonality in disease incidence has been attributed to seasonal changes in pathogen transmission rates, resulting from fluctuations in extrinsic climate factors. Multi-strain infectious diseases with strain-specific seasonal signatures, such as cholera, indicate that a range of seasonal patterns in transmission rates is possible in identical environments. We therefore consider pathogens capable of evolving their 'seasonal phenotype', a trait that determines the sensitivity of their transmission rates to environmental variability. We introduce a theoretical framework, based on adaptive dynamics, for predicting the evolution of disease dynamics in seasonal environments. Changes in the seasonality of environmental factors are one important avenue for the effects of climate change on disease. This model also provides a framework for examining these effects on pathogen evolution and associated disease dynamics. An application of this approach gives an explanation for the recent cholera strain replacement in Bangladesh, based on changes in monsoon rainfall patterns.},

In 11 of these 22 subsets there was significant variation in the degree of aggregation between host subsets of the same host-parasite system. A common k estimate was always larger than that obtained with all the host data considered together. These results indicate that lumping host data can hide important variations in aggregation between hosts and can exaggerate the true degree of aggregation. Wherever possible common k estimates should be used to estimate the degree of aggregation. In addition, significant differences in the degree of aggregation between subgroups of host data, were generally associated with significant differences in both mean parasite burdens and the prevalence of infection.},

abstract = {The existence of periodic oscillations in populations of forest Lepidoptera is well known. While information exists on how the periods of oscillations vary among different species, there is little prior evidence of variation in periodicity within the range of a single Lepidopteran species. The exotic gypsy moth is an introduced foliage-feeding insect in North America. Its populations are characterized by high amplitude oscillations between innocuously low densities and outbreak levels during which large regions of forests are defoliated. These outbreaks are recognized to arise periodically with considerable synchrony across much of the gypsy moth's North American range. Our analysis indicates that gypsy moth outbreaks in North America are periodic but they exhibit two dominant periodicities: a primary period of 8-10 yr (as previously reported) and a secondary period of 4-5 yr (a new finding in this study). The outbreak periodicity varied geographically and this variation was associated with forest type. We found that in the most susceptible forest types, those on xeric sites where oak is often mixed with pines, outbreak periodicity had a more dominant 5-yr period while in forest types characteristic of more mesic sites where oak was mixed with maples and other species, cycles were clearly operating on a 10-yr period.},

Populations of infective juvenile nematodes in soil were monitored at 30-day intervals over 120 days using wax moth larvae as baits. After application of S. carpocapsae, S. glaseri, or the combination of both species, hosts were added at 30-day intervals. With hosts at 0 cm depth, each nematode species was negatively affected by the presence of the other species at the 30- and 60-day samples. At 90 and 120 days, S. carpocapsae numbers in the combined treatment were as high as in the single species treatment, whereas only few S. glaseri were recovered. With hosts at 2 or 10 cm depth, the presence of S. glaseri had a strong negative effect on S. carpocapsae, but S. glaseri was not affected by the presence of S. carpocapsae. In another experiment, S. carpocapsae dominated over S. glaseri in hosts located at 0 cm depth as measured by penetration efficiency into hosts and progeny production. In contrast, S. glaseri dominated at 2 cm depth. At 2 cm depth, S. carpocapsae penetrated into hosts too slowly to compete successfully with S. glaseri. Steinernema carpocapsae is superior to S. glaseri when competing for a host on the soil surface; however, below the surface S. glaseri is superior to S. carpocapsae.},

We examine the direct and indirect effects of parasitism and discuss examples of density and parasite-induced trait-mediated effects. Recent work reveals previously unrecognized complexity in parasite-mediated interactions. In addition to parasite-modified and apparent competition leading to species exclusion or enabling coexistence, parasites and predators interact in different ways to regulate or destablize the population dynamics of their joint prey. An emerging area is the impact of parasites on intraguild predation (IGP). Parasites can increase vulnerability of infected individuals to cannibalism or predation resulting in reversed species dominance in IGP hierarchies. We discuss the potential significance of parasites for community structure and biodiversity, in particular their role in promoting species exclusion or coexistence and the impact of emerging diseases. Ongoing invasions provide examples where parasites mediate native/invader interactions and play a key role in determining the outcome of invasions. We highlight the need for more quantitative data to assess the impact of parasites on communities, and the combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how the effects of parasitism scale up to community-level processes.},

abstract = {The presence of Heterorhabditis indica in the littoral zone of continental Guadeloupe was assessed by the Galleria trap technique. A total of 309 samples from 192 sampling sites were analysed. Heterorhabditis indica was found in 74 samples from 53 sites (45 beaches and eight limestone cliffs). The ecological characteristics of these places (climate, soil, flora and fauna) were described and the arthropods occupying these locations were tested for their ability to support nematode development. The spatial distribution of H. indica showed that the colonisation of these sites by nematodes is due to a permanent occurrence of patches generally found under the canopy of trees. An annual monitoring (performed in the wet season from 1996-2005) showed that these patches were regularly recovered (10 consecutive years). The population dynamics of H. indica was studied monthly in two sites for 28 months. In both sites, the abundance of nematodes was directly correlated to rainfall. In the dry season, when the soil moisture was lower than 3.5\%, nematodes were not detected by the insect traps. The infective juveniles can survive about 6-7 months in such an environment. Field experiments with sterilised soil showed that nematode-free soil is normally recolonised by active migration but recolonisation can also occur when this route is excluded, indicating either infected insects or passive transport (human or animal) as alternative routes.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a relationship between the foraging strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes and the pattern of emergence of male and female infective juveniles from their host. We hypothesize that protandry as a mating strategy may be most adaptive in situations where cruising search is employed to find hosts. Alternatively, when attachment to a host is more passive, as in ambush foraging, a more constantly female-biased sex ratio should be maintained. Cruise-foraging infective juvenile Steinernema glaseri that develop into adult males emerge from host cadavers before those that develop into females and are immediately sensitive to volatile host cues. Females that emerge later are less attracted to host volatiles than are males during the first week of the infective stage. However, recently emerged females are strongly attracted to parasitized hosts. Infective juvenile Steinernema carpocapsae showed the opposite trend, with significantly more females emerging on the first day than the later harvest. In most protandrous mating systems, males take the risks of colonizing a new resource. The benefit derived by the early males is to have prolonged access to females inside the new host. Females penetrate into the safer parasitized hosts to find males. Their chances of prereproductive death are decreased in two ways; males prepare the host by breaking down defenses, and males make it possible for the females to mate immediately when they reach adulthood. Reported variability between harvests of S. glaseri may be partially attributed to protandry. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Coevolutionary interactions such as those between hosts and parasites have been regarded as an underlying cause of evolutionary diversification, but evidence from natural populations is limited. Among primates and other mammalian groups, measures of host diversification rates vary widely among lineages, but comparative studies have not yet identified a reliable explanation for this variation. In this study, we used a comprehensive data set of disease-causing organisms from free-living primates to illustrate how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to examine mammalian lineage diversity in relation to parasite species richness. Our results provide evidence that the phylogenetic diversity of primate clades is correlated positively with the number of parasite species harbored by each host and that this pattern is largely independent of other host traits that have been shown to influence diversification rates and parasite species richness in primates. We investigated two possible mechanisms that could explain this association, namely that parasites themselves drive host evolutionary diversification through processes linked with sexual selection and that host shifts or host sharing increases parasite species richness among diverse primate clades. Neither parasite species richness nor host diversification is related to measures of sexual selection in primates. Further, we found only partial evidence that more rapidly diversifying host lineages produced increased opportunities for host sharing or host shifting by parasites through mechanisms involving species' geographic range overlap. Thus, our analyses provide evidence for an important link between the evolutionary diversification of primates and the richness of their parasite communities, but other mechanisms, particularly those related to reciprocal selection or coextinction of hosts and parasites, require further investigation.},

abstract = {Outbreaks of many infectious diseases, including cholera, malaria and dengue, vary over characteristic periods longer than 1 year(1,2). Evidence that climate variability drives these interannual cycles has been highly controversial, chiefly because it is difficult to isolate the contribution of environmental forcing while taking into account nonlinear epidemiological dynamics generated by mechanisms such as host immunity(2-4). Here we show that a critical interplay of environmental forcing, specifically climate variability, and temporary immunity explains the interannual disease cycles present in a four-decade cholera time series from Matlab, Bangladesh. We reconstruct the transmission rate, the key epidemiological parameter affected by extrinsic forcing, over time for the predominant strain ( El Tor) with a nonlinear population model that permits a contributing effect of intrinsic immunity. Transmission shows clear interannual variability with a strong correspondence to climate patterns at long periods ( over 7 years, for monsoon rains and Brahmaputra river discharge) and at shorter periods ( under 7 years, for flood extent in Bangladesh, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal and the El Nino Southern Oscillation). The importance of the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors in determining disease dynamics is illustrated during refractory periods, when population susceptibility levels are low as the result of immunity and the size of cholera outbreaks only weakly reflects climate forcing.},

abstract = {Entomopathogenic nematodes are important biological control agents for a variety of soil- and litter-dwelling insect pests. A major drawback to their use against pest species is their low level of persistence in many agricultural systems. While a number of studies have examined the persistence of these biological control agents over periods of days and/or weeks, the longer-term survival of these nematodes has received less attention. We report the results of a year-long field experiment testing the long-term survival of infective juveniles (IJs) of the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis marelatus (Liu and Berry), under a range of initial densities. We buried mesh-covered tubes containing raw field soil with varying densities of H. marelatus IJs in a coastal prairie containing naturally occurring populations of this nematode and then destructively sampled subsets of the tubes for nematode presence five times over I yr. H. marelatus IJs lived a surprisingly long time in the absence of prey: some nematodes from the initial cohort were viable after a year in the field. Survival over the year-long course of the experiment was independent of the starting IJ density, Suggesting that H. marelatus does not aggregate at high densities to reduce desiccation risk. Our results highlight the fact that IJs vary greatly in their long-term survival; selecting entomopathogenic nematode isolates for persistence as well as virulence could enhance this biological control agent's long-term effectiveness in agricultural systems.},

The role of climate change in the exacerbation of the disease has been controversial, and the specific influence of rising temperature (warming) has been highly debated following a previous study reporting no evidence to support a trend in temperature. We revisit this result using the same temperature data, now updated to the present from 1950 to 2002 for four high-altitude sites in East Africa where malaria has become a serious public health problem. With both nonparametric and parametric statistical analyses, we find evidence for a significant warming trend at all sites. To assess the biological significance of this trend, we drive a dynamical model for the population dynamics of the mosquito vector with the temperature time series and the corresponding detrended versions. This approach suggests that the observed temperature changes would be significantly amplified by the mosquito population dynamics with a difference in the biological response at least 1 order of magnitude larger than that in the environmental variable. Our results emphasize the importance of considering not just the statistical significance of climate trends but also their biological implications with dynamical models.},

Combinations of imidacloprid and S, kushidai Mamiya only resulted in additive mortality, The synergistic interaction was also observed in field trials but the results were more variable than those under greenhouse conditions. The combination of nematodes and imidacloprid could be used for curative treatments of white grub infestations, especially against scarab species that are less susceptible to nematodes and/or imidacloprid, This combination has a low environmental impact and high compatibility with natural biological control of turfgrass insects. The possible roles of these combinations in augmentative control approaches are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Dispersal ability is of great importance for plants, which commonly occupy spatially and temporally limited substrate patches. Mixed reproductive strategies with abundant diaspore production are favoured in a heterogeneous landscape to ensure successful colonisation at different distances. In bryophytes, long-distance dispersal has been thought to take place primarily by spores, while asexual propagules are important in local dispersal and in the maintenance of colonies. In the present study, we investigated the dispersal potential of two equally sized propagules, sexually formed spores and asexually produced gemmae in the dioecious, epixylic hepatic, Anastrophyllum hellerianum, which inhabits spatially and temporally limited substrate patches. We trapped propagules at different distances (0-10 m) and directions from the source colonies in two experiments: one in a natural habitat within a forest and another involving an artificial set-up in an open habitat. Spore dispersal showed only slight distance dependence both in the open and the forest habitats, presumably as a consequence of wind affecting the dispersal pattern. Gemma dispersal was more strongly distance-dependent in the open habitat than in the forest sites. Considerably more gemmae were deposited during rainy than dry periods, possibly because of the effect of rain drops on gemma release. However, weather conditions had no effect on the dispersal patterns of spores or gemmae. In A. hellerianum, the combination of occasional spore production and practically continuous, massive gemma production facilitates dispersal both on local scale and over long distances. Unlike previously assumed, not only spores but also the asexual propagules may contribute to long-distance dispersal, thus allowing considerable gene flow at the landscape level.},

abstract = {We examine the degree to which field observers can meet the assumptions underlying line transect sampling to monitor populations of desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii). We present the results of 2 field trials using artificial tortoise models in 3 size classes. The trials were conducted on 2 occasions on an area south of Las Vegas, Nevada, where the density of the test population was known. In the first trials, conducted largely by experienced biologists who had been involved in tortoise surveys for many years, the density of adult tortoise models was well estimated (-3.9\% bias),while the bias was higher (-20\%) for subadult tortoise models. The bias for combined data was -12.0\%. The bias was largely attributed to the failure to detect all tortoise models on or near the that first centerline. The second trials were conducted with a group of largely inexperienced student volunteers and used somewhat different searching methods, and the results were similar to the first trials. Estimated combined density of subadult and adult tortoise models had a negative bias (-7.3\%), again attributable to failure to detect some models on or near the centerline. Experience in desert tortoise biology, either comparing the first and second trials or in the second trial with 2 experienced biologists versus 16 novices, did not have an apparent effect on the quality of the data or the accuracy of the estimates. Observer training, specific to line transect sampling, and field testing are important components of a reliable survey. Line transect sampling represents a viable method for large-scale monitoring of populations of desert tortoise; however, field protocol must be improved to assure the key assumptions are met.},

abstract = {Plants under attack by arthropod herbivores often emit volatile compounds from their leaves that attract natural enemies of the herbivores. Here we report the first identification of an insect-induced belowground plant signal, (E)-beta-caryophyllene, which strongly attracts an entomopathogenic nematode. Maize roots release this sesquiterpene in response to feeding by larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a maize pest that is currently invading Europe. Most North American maize lines do not release (E)-beta-caryophyllene, whereas European lines and the wild maize ancestor, teosinte, readily do so in response to D. v. virgifera attack. This difference was consistent with striking differences in the attractiveness of representative lines in the laboratory. Field experiments showed a fivefold higher nematode infection rate of D. v. virgifera larvae on a maize variety that produces the signal than on a variety that does not, whereas spiking the soil near the latter variety with authentic (E)-beta-caryophyllene decreased the emergence of adult D. v. virgifera to less than half. North American maize lines must have lost the signal during the breeding process. Development of new varieties that release the attractant in adequate amounts should help enhance the efficacy of nematodes as biological control agents against root pests like D. v. virgifera},

abstract = {Allochthonous marine input is a key component of the dynamics of islands and terrestrial coastal ecosystems on islands in the Gulf of California, Mexico, where an unproductive desert juxtaposes a highly productive ocean. In this area, seabirds are a major conduit bringing marine productivity to land. Seabirds leave guano on roosting and nesting islands, and carrion on nesting islands. We analyze how seabirds affect the abundance of a dominant consumer group, tenebrionid beetles, on 25 islands in the Gulf of California over a three-year period. Tenebrionid densities vary by three orders of magnitude among islands. Beetles are most abundant in areas influenced by seabirds: they are approximately five times more dense on nesting and roosting islands than on other islands and on mainland sites, and approximately six times more dense inside vs. outside colonies. Path analyses show that seabirds significantly affect beetles by two distinct pathways. On roosting islands, effects are mainly indirect: guano, a fertilizing nutrient, significantly enhances plant productivity; beetles eat plant detritus. On nesting islands, significant effects are primarily direct: beetles eat seabird carrion; the indirect pathway (guano and plants) contributes little on these islands. By providing energy and nutrients to fuel a diverse array of consumer populations, seabirds are central to the dynamics of these island ecosystems. Scavengers and avian parasites directly increase by eating seabird products. Likewise, populations of consumers that eat detritus, plant tissues, and seeds are enhanced indirectly via the fertilizing effects of guano on plants. Increases in these primary consumers indirectly facilitate high densities of many predators. Thus, consumer populations on these islands are deeply subsidized by substantial input from seabirds. Because consumers cannot influence the renewal rate of their allochthonous resources, the dynamics of these consumers and their food webs are largely donor controlled.},

abstract = {Many microbial pathogens can switch to new hosts or adopt alternative transmission routes as environmental conditions change, displaying unexpected flexibility in their infection pathways and often causing emerging diseases. In contrast, parasitic worms that must develop through a fixed series of host species appear less likely to show phenotypic plasticity in their transmission pathways. Here, I demonstrate experimentally that a trematode parasite, Coitocaecum parvum, can accelerate its development and rapidly reach precocious maturity in its crustacean intermediate host in the absence of chemical cues emanating from its fish definitive host. Juvenile trematodes can also mature precociously when the mortality rate of their intermediate hosts is increased. Eggs produced by precocious adults hatch into viable larvae, capable of pursuing the parasite's life cycle. In the absence of chemical cues from fish hosts, the size of eggs released by precocious trematodes in their intermediate hosts becomes more variable, possibly indicating a bet-hedging strategy. These results illustrate that parasitic worms with complex life cycles have development and transmission strategies that are more plastic than commonly believed, allowing them to skip one host in their cycle when they perceive limited opportunities for transmission.},

We used a large-scale 4-year dataset to study the spatial dynamics of Podosphaera plantaginis, an obligate pathogen of Plantago lanceolata in the Aland Islands in south-west Finland, where the host populations are mostly very small and have a scattered spatial distribution. 2 The fraction of host populations infected was low but highly variable among years, ranging from 1\% to 4.7\%, with frequent local extinction and colonization events. Demographic stochasticity associated with regular seasonal declines and severe drought was responsible for the high extinction rate. Frequent colonizations of host populations close to the pathogen source populations suggest that there is substantial gene flow in the pathogen at spatial scales up to 1 km. 3 Occurrence of the pathogen was strongly and positively correlated with the logarithm of host population size, the proximity of a road to the host population (presumably facilitating dispersal) and the proximity of the coastline (presumably due to microclimatic conditions favouring pathogen development). 4 The high turnover rate of the pathogen, distance-dependent dispersal and regional variation in host-pathogen encounter rates have consequences for the coevolutionary dynamics between Plantago lanceolata and Podosphaera plantaginis.},

abstract = {We conducted assays to determine if characteristics of entomopathogenic nematodes vary in response to continued exposure to a particular insect/host plant combination, and whether selection results in changed performance on other insect/host plant combinations. Three isolates of Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Agriotos, Mexican, and Hybrid) were continuously cultured in corn-fed (Zea mays L.) or squash-fed (Cueurbita pepo L.) southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimptinetata howardi Barber for 25 passages. The rootworm-selected nematodes were compared to the same isolates maintained on Galleria mellonella (L.) ("unselected"). There was no increase in the ability to kill rootworms in selected nematodes compared to unselected nematodes. Among rootworm-selected nematodes, there were changes based on the host plant on which the rootworms had fed. The ability of nematodes selected on corn-fed rootworms to kill corn-fed rootworms compared to squash-fed rootworms improved in the Mexican and Agriotos isolates. The squash-selected Mexican isolate lost virulence against rootworms. Virulence of the Hybrid isolate did not change in response to selection on rootworms or host plant/rootworm combination. In general, changes in infective juvenile (IJ) production were not related to number of passages through rootworms. Using computer-aided image analysis, we measured the effects of selection on length and neutral lipid density and area in U. IJ selected on corn-fed rootworms were longer than those selected on squash-fed rootworms or maintained in G. mellonella. Length of U was positively correlated with the area of stained neutral lipids. The Hybrid isolate had a greater area and density of stained lipids than the Agriotos or Mexican isolates. U from nematodes selected on corn-fed rootworms tended to have a greater area of stained lipids, but not lipid density, compared with U selected on squash-fed rootworms or maintained in G. mellonella. There was a pattern for an inverse relationship between numbers of U produced and measures of lipid content. This pattern is discussed with reference to trade-offs in life history characteristics. Our results suggest that some characteristics of entomopathogenic nematodes can respond to selection on insect host plant, but that changes are dependent on the nematode isolate and the particular host plant on which the insect feeds.

We combine epidemiological concepts to summarise fungal growth dynamics with percolation theory to derive and test the following hypotheses: first fungal invasion into a population of susceptible sites on a lattice can be stopped by a threshold proportion of randomly removed sites; second random removal of susceptible sites from a population introduces a shield which can prevent invasion of unprotected sites; and third the rate at which a susceptible population is invaded reduces with increasing number of randomly protected sites.

Despite the importance of food chain models in instigating ecological investigations, many empirical studies still show a strong deviation from the dynamics that food chain models predict. We present a theoretical framework that explains some of the discrepancies by showing that trophic interactions are likely to be strongly influenced by the spatial configuration of consumers and their resources. Differences in the spatial scale at which consumers and their resources function lead to uncoupling of the population dynamics of the interacting species, and may explain overexploitation and depletion of resource populations. We discuss how changed land use, likely the most prominent future stress on natural systems, may affect food web dynamics by interfering with the scale of interaction between consumers and their resource.},

abstract = {Background Mathematical models have become invaluable management tools for epidemiologists, both shedding light on the mechanisms underlying observed dynamics as well as making quantitative predictions on the effectiveness of different control measures. Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models. Methods and Findings First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options. Conclusion This work aims to highlight that, when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.},

abstract = {The Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen interaction has been studied extensively with regard to its epidemiology and population genetic structure (host resistance and pathogen virulence) in a natural metapopulation. In this study, this system was used in an experimental metapopulation approach to investigate explicitly how the distance (degree of isolation) between local population patches influences disease dynamics within a growing season, as well as the genetic structure of pathogen populations through stochastic colonization and extinction processes. The experimental design centred on four replicate sets of populations, within which patches were spaced at increasingly greater distances apart. Each patch consisted of an identical set of host and pathogen genotypes, with each pathogen genotype having the ability to attack only one of four host-resistance types. Over the 2 years of the experiment, the results showed clear 'boom-and-bust' epidemic patterns, with the strongest determinant of disease dynamics within a growing season being the identity of particular host-pathogen genotypic combinations. However, there were also significant effects of spatial structure, in that more isolated patches tended to exhibit lower levels of disease during epidemic peaks than patches that were close together. Extinction of pathogen genotypes from individual populations was positively related to the severity of disease during preceding epidemic peaks, but negatively related to the level of disease present at the final census prior to overwintering. The probability of recolonization of pathotypes into populations during the second growing season was most strongly related to the distance to the nearest neighbouring source population in which a given pathotype was present. Overall, these results highlight the importance of spatial scale in influencing the numerical and genetical dynamics of pathogen populations.},

abstract = {Communities of organisms form as a result of both interspecific and abiotic interactions within local habitat patches and dispersal among patches in a region. Local processes are expected to play a dominant role when dispersal occurs much more often than extinction. We performed two field experiments to examine rates and mechanisms of dispersal in freshwater pond zooplankton communities. First, we tested the effect of distance from a source on the rate of colonization of artificial habitat by placing wading pools at 5, 10, 30 and 60 m from two natural fishless ponds and observing the succession of zooplankton. Seventy-eight percent of the species in the source ponds that were capable of living in the pools colonized at least once during the experiment. A new species was found in the pools on average once every four days, suggesting that colonization events occur on the order of days to weeks for many species. Colonization rates declined further from the source at one pond but not the other, and the effect of distance was relatively weak at both ponds. This suggests that many species disperse broadly over short distances. The second experiment tested the role of animal vectors for zooplankton dispersal by restricting access to the pools. Eight treatments were imposed that excluded potential animal vectors along a body size gradient from large mammals to small insects. While the treatments affected zooplankton colonization, many species invaded even when all animals larger than 1 mm were excluded. Animal vectors may therefore be less important for dispersal than wind. Our results suggest that zooplankton are highly effective dispersers over short distances, and can disperse via several mechanisms. Local interactions should therefore play a dominant role in structuring these communities at small regional scales},

We presented host materials to nematodes in series to test responses to combinations of host cues. If a fixed hierarchy of cues is followed during foraging, parasites should respond most strongly to cues offered in natural order. Steinernema cavpocapsae, an ambush forager, aggregated at the source of volatile host cues only after attachment to host cuticle. They also parasitized hosts more efficiently after contact with cuticle. Steinernema glaseri, a cruise forager, was unaffected by exposure to combinations of host cues. Steinernema feltiae, a nematode with characteristics of both ambushing and cruising, was affected by cue hierarchies when either contact or volatile cues were presented first. Host-associated materials encountered out of the context may not qualify as host cues for the ambush forager, S. carpocapsae. Perhaps the order in which cues are encountered is more predictable for ambushers than for cruisers. Therefore an ambusher's response to host materials has a more fixed contextual framework.},

This is partly due to a fundamental limitation of less-than-full likelihood methods. The paper addresses the question of how to get as much as possible from solely the first- and second-order properties of the data without going to a full likelihood system. We first analyse the source of bias in the working vector and the marginal variance formula, and then propose a two-staged quasi likelihood to reduce the bias. The main advantage of the method is that it retains the appealing conceptual and computational simplicity of the normal-based likelihood formulation, without the need of an analytical bias correction. The methodology is validated by simulations and by theoretical analyses, and illustrated using real datasets from the salamander mating experiment.},

abstract = {Traditional expectations for how widely and how often freshwater invertebrates disperse differ from empirical data. Freshwater invertebrates have been characterized as frequent, widespread dispersers, particularly those that are transported passively. Our review finds that this characterization may describe the potential for dispersal in some taxa, but it is not an accurate generalization for actual dispersal rates. High variance among habitats and taxonomic groups is a consistent theme. Advances in population genetics may help resolve these issues, but underlying assumptions should be carefully tested. Further, even unbiased estimates of gene flow may not equate with individual movement, because not all dispersers survive and reproduce. Some freshwater invertebrates may exist in classic Levins metapopulations. However, other species fit into a broader metapopulation definition, where temporal dispersal via diapause is functionally equivalent to spatial dispersal. In the latter case, local extinctions and rescue effects may be rare or absent. Finally, limited dispersal rates in many taxa suggest that theories of freshwater community assembly and structure can be made more robust by integrating dispersal and local processes as joint, contingent regulators. Recent research on freshwater invertebrate dispersal has substantially advanced our basic and applied understanding of freshwaters, as well as evolutionary ecology in general},

abstract = {We studied the interactions between two entomopathogenic nematode species each with a different foraging behavior in the presence of two hosts at different soil depths. One week after nematode inoculation, hosts were added to the soil and additional hosts added at 30-day intervals. The densities of infective juveniles of the two nematode species were monitored over 90 to 180-day periods in soil samples or directly in the experimental containers using wax moth larvae as baits. Host placement in the soil strongly influenced the outcome of the competition between the sit-and-wait forager (ambusher) Steinernema carpocapsae and active forager (cruiser) S. glaseri. When hosts were introduced at 2 and 10 cm depths, few S. carpocapsae were recovered at 60 days and onwards after the first hosts had been introduced. S. glaseri, on the other hand, was not adversely affected by the presence of S. carpocapsae. When hosts were introduced at 0 and 10 cm depths, S. carpocapsae persisted in the presence of S. glaseri at significantly lower numbers than when it was alone, whereas S. glaseri was not significantly affected by the presence of S. carpocapsae. Numbers of recovered S. glaseri however, tended to decrease after 30-60 days, even in the absence of its competitor. We postulate that this decrease was because of its high susceptibility to intraspecific competition. In the combination of S. carpocapsae and the active forager Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, S. carpocapsae dominated the system during the first 90 days, and H. bacteriophora dominated during the last 60 days. In the laboratory, an ambusher and a cruiser entomopathogenic nematode species can coexist. In the field, many other factors will influence the population dynamics, and the higher diversity should promote the coexistence of entomopathogenic nematode species with different foraging behavior.},

Our comparative numerical analysis shows that when the ASFOIs for the two diseases largely overlap, the dynamics predicted by the two-disease model are generally different from those predicted by the analogous single-disease model, suggesting strong fingerprints of disease interference. When the ASFOIs overlap less, on the other hand, both diseases behave as predicted by the single-disease model, suggesting weak interference.

Such a reproductive mode helps minimize seed losses through predator satiation and extinction of seed predator populations. The seed predators can buffer the resource variation through dispersal or extended diapause. We developed a spatially explicit resource-consumer model to understand the effect of masting on specialist seed predators. The masting dynamics were assumed to follow a resource-based model for plant reproduction, and the population dynamics of the predator were represented by a spatially extended Nicholson-Bailey model. The resultant model demonstrated that when host plants reproduce intermittently, seed predator populations go locally extinct, but global persistence of the predator is facilitated by dispersal or extended diapause. Global extinction of the predator resulted when the intermittent reproduction is highly synchronized among plants. An approximate invasion criterion for the predators showed that negative lag-1 autocorrelation in seeding reduces invasibility, and positive lag-1 cross-correlation enhances invasibility. Spatial synchronization in seeding at local scale caused by pollen coupling ( or climate forcing) further prevented invasion of the predators. If the predators employed extended diapause, extremely high temporal variability in reproduction was required for plants to evade the predators.},

Nematode persistence in these systems tends to be poor. Many theoretical mechanisms have been proposed whereby spatial structure can promote population persistence.

We applied H. bacteriophora (2.5 x 10(9) ha(-1)) to 3 x 3 m plots of turf in three spatial patterns: (1) uniform distribution; (2) one central circular patch (diameter 1.12m); and (3) nine individual patches (diameter 0.38m). Nematode persistence and spatial distribution were monitored over I year. In all treatments, nematode numbers declined to similar levels. Over time, the nematodes applied in patches moved from their initial application sites and became more evenly distributed, whereas the distribution of nematodes in plots with uniform application became patchier as nematodes died. No significant differences were observed in nematode numbers or spatial pattern from week 20 until the end of the experiment. Grub densities were measured at the end of the experiment. Nematodes that had been applied uniformly or in nine patches significantly reduced grub numbers, but the one-patch application did not. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The distribution of organisms can be regulated by local environmental factors and regional processes such as dispersal. Here, we review recent work on the role of dispersal for generating population and community structure in freshwater zooplankton. We examine evidence for different mechanisms of dispersal among lakes, for the effects of dispersal limitations on populations and communities, and for the effects of spatial scale on dispersal rates. Zooplankton move via human or animal vectors, flowing surface waters, and wind; the relative importance of the different modes of transport is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that dispersal among lakes separated over short spatial scales (<10 km) is sufficiently rapid that local interactions should limit species diversity and composition more than the supply of colonists. However, dispersal limitation over broad scales (tens to thousands of kilometers) might constrain geographic ranges and influence community structure. The current explosion in the incidence of exotic species indicates that such global- or continental-scale dispersal was limiting in the past. The spread of exotic species also provides opportunities to study the scale dependence of zooplankton dispersal. We show how patterns of range expansion can be used to estimate the change in invasion likelihood with distance to a source population. Such dispersal functions provide a crucial link between small-scale experimental studies and broad-scale geographic patterns},

Motivated by laboratory data for an insect and its parasitoid, we investigate whether such assumptions are appropriate when considering the population dynamics of a single species and its interaction with a natural enemy. Specifically, we examine the effects of developmental variability and demographic stochasticity on different types of cyclic dynamics predicted by traditional models. We show that predictions based on the deterministic fixed-development approach are differentially sensitive to variability and noise in key life stages. In particular, we find that the demonstration of half-generation cycles in the single-species model and the multigeneration cycles in the host-parasitoid model are sensitive to the introduction of developmental variability and noise, whereas generation cycles are robust to the intrinsic variability and uncertainty that may be found in nature.},

abstract = {The measurement of plant dispersal is vital for understanding plant distribution and abundance at different scales. However, dispersal is difficult to measure and there is a lack of guidance for researchers new to the subject. In this paper we provide advice on methods for measuring dispersal in the field and approaches to experimental design. First, we encourage clear exposition of the aims of the dispersal study and the ultimate use to which the data will be put (e.g. local dynamics, invasion processes, etc). We outline the types of dispersal exhibited by plants and emphasise that many species are dispersed by multiple processes, which are not necessarily related to putative adaptations. Few studies properly address the full range of processes by which a species is dispersed. We review methods for measuring plant dispersal, summarising the type of dispersal measured and problems with each method. We then outline the major questions about effort to be considered in sampling protocols and present an optimisation algorithm for designing dispersal studies given a suite of options, and biological and resource constraints. We propose and demonstrate a simulation modelling approach to comparing the data quality obtained by alternative experimental designs. Integrating simulation models with pilot studies offers a rapid route to improved estimation methods. We then discuss functions commonly fit to dispersal data and recommend caution as none is a priori the best description of the dispersal process. Finally, we call for a better description and understanding of dispersal kernels by: a more rigorous approach to designing dispersal measurement; better targeting of dispersal studies to particular questions; and achieving a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying dispersal, so that we can move from descriptions of pattern to a grasp of process.},

abstract = {1. Entomopathogenic nematodes belonging to the families Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae are lethal obligate parasites of a wide range of invertebrate species. These nematodes exhibit many characteristics that make them ideal candidates as biological control agents of insect pests (rapid host death, high reproductive rates, easily mass-reared in vitro, easy application techniques). 2. However, at present, the number of pest species to which these nematodes are applied successfully is small. Clearly, there is a need to develop existing knowledge of the nematode into a more complete understanding of the nematode-pest system as a whole. 3. To consider the potential of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents, we adopted a generalized analytical modelling approach and, using realistic parameter estimates, determined the conditions under which these nematodes can regulate a pest population. 4. Stability analyses suggested that entomopathogenic nematodes may not be capable of regulating a host population to a stable equilibrium. Long-term persistence of the host and nematode population is unlikely, due to the highly destabilizing effects of the parasite-host relationship. As such, these nematodes may be better suited to short-term control through inundative application techniques rather than long-term regulation. 5. This preliminary generalized model highlights areas where further work is needed. This includes estimation of the probability of nematode infection in the field, the effect of host size on the transmission cycle and the influence of spatial heterogeneity on stability.},

abstract = {Multihost parasites have been implicated in the emergence of new diseases in humans and wildlife, yet little is known about factors that influence the host range of parasites in natural populations. We used a comprehensive data set of 415 micro- and macroparasites reported from 119 wild primate hosts to investigate broad patterns of host specificity. The majority (68\%) of primate parasites were reported to infect multiple host species, including animals from multiple families or orders. This pattern corresponds to previous studies of parasites found in humans and domesticated animals. Within three parasite groups (viruses, protozoans and helminths), we examined parasite taxonomy and transmission strategy in relation to measures of host specificity. Relative to other parasite groups, helminths were associated with the greatest levels of host specificity, whereas most viruses were reported to infect hosts from multiple families or orders. Highly significant associations between the degree of host specificity and transmission strategy arose within each parasite group, but not always in the same direction, suggesting that unique constraints influence the host range of parasites within each taxonomic group. Finally characteristics of over 100 parasite species shared between wild primates and humans, including those recognised as emerging in humans, revealed that most of these shared parasites were reported from multiple host orders. Furthermore, nearly all viruses that were reported to infect both humans and non-human primates were classified as emerging in humans. (C) 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Using data collected from 152 Missouri (USA) lakes over seven years, we asked whether models based on dispersal. or local-scale processes best predicted invasion by. the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi. We used multiple logistic regression to test the relative importance of 10 local physicochemical features and proximity to all known potential source populations for predicting which lakes were invaded. The decline in invasion likelihood with distance to source populations was-used to estimate the shape of the dispersal kernel. Between 1992 and 1998 the cumulative prevalence of D. lumholtzi increased from 6\% to 34\% of lakes sampled, with frequent appearances of populations in new watersheds. Spatial position and physical factors were both important for predicting the new colonization events. The probability of colonization increased with lake surface area and epilimnetic temperature, declined with increasing conductivity, and was unaffected by variation in lake fertility. Invasion likelihood declined sharply as a nonlinear function of distance to source populations up to around 30 km, and was relatively constant at greater distances. The results suggest that dispersal and local abiotic constraints jointly limit the spread of D. lumholtzi. This approach illustrates how range expansion can be used to estimate dispersal rates at broad spatial scales},

abstract = {In early 1994, a novel strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG)-a poultry pathogen with a world-wide distribution-emerged in wild house finches and within 3 years had reached epidemic proportions across their eastern North American range. The ensuing epizootic resulted in a rapid decline of the host population coupled with considerable seasonal fluctuations in prevalence. To understand the dynamics of this disease system, a multi-disciplinary team composed of biologists, veterinarians, microbiologists and mathematical modelers set forth to determine factors driving and influenced by this host-pathogen system. On a broad geographic scale, volunteer observers ("citizen scientists") collected and reported data used for calculating both host abundance and disease prevalence. The scale at which this monitoring initiative was conducted is unprecedented and it has been an invaluable source of data for researchers at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology to track the spread and magnitude of disease both spatially and temporally. At a finer scale, localized and intensive field studies provided data used to quantify the effects of disease on host demographic parameters via capture-mark-recapture modeling, effects of host behavior on disease and vice-versa, and the biological and genetic profiles of birds with known phenotypic characteristics. To balance the field-based component of the study, experiments were conducted with finches held in captivity to describe and quantify the effects of experimental infections on hosts in both individual and social settings. The confluence of these various elements of the investigation provided the foundation for construction of a general compartmentalized epidemiological model of the dynamics of the house finch-MG system. This paper serves several purposes including (i) a basic review of the pathogen, host, and epidemic cycle, 60 an explanation of our research strategy; (iii) a basic review of results from the diverse multi-disciplinary approaches employed: and (iv) pertinent questions relevant to this and other wildlife disease studies that require further investigation, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This, in turn, can result in spatial differentiation in the timing of epidemics and, depending on the nature of spatial contagion, may result in traveling waves. Measles epidemics are one of a few systems documented well enough to reveal all of these properties and how they are affected by spatiotemporal variations in population structure and demography. On the basis of a gravity coupling model and a time series susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) model for local dynamics, we propose a metapopulation model for regional measles dynamics. The model can capture all the major spatiotemporal properties in prevaccination epidemics of measles in England and Wales.},

abstract = {We studied the dynamics of a univoltine stream-dwelling caddistly, Brachycentrus americanus, and its microsporidian disease for 15 yr. The pathogen is highly virulent. with infections generally resulting in death during the larval stage. In most years, we sampled Brachycentrus immatures every 1-2 mo to estimate population density and disease prevalence. Brachycentrus population dynamics exhibited strong evidence for direct and delayed (1 generation lag) density dependence and appeared to cycle with a period of similar to4 yr. Pathogen prevalence in Brachycentrus was > 10\% in all generations and frequently exceeded 50\%. Disease prevalence also exhibited cyclic behavior. with peaks in prevalence following Brachycentrus generations with relatively high population density. There was no evidence for direct density-dependent parasitism. but there was strong evidence for density-dependent infection delayed by one generation. A path analysis model suggested that the disease mediated much of the strong density dependence observed in Brachycentrus. Collectively, these observations suggest that the pathogen is largely responsible for driving observed Brachycentrus dynamics.},

abstract = {1. Previous studies of insect dynamics have detected spatial synchrony in intraspecific population dynamics up to, but not exceeding, 1000 km. Oddly, interspecific synchrony has recently been reported at distances well over 1000 km (at continental and circumpolar scales). While the authors implicated climatic effects as the cause for the apparent large-scale interspecific synchrony, there is no evidence that weather data are synchronized over such great distances. 2. In the present study, intraspecific circumpolar synchrony in the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), was tested for among 11 regions across three continents (North America, Europe and Asia). Analyses indicate that most gypsy moth populations around the world tend to oscillate at periodicities between 8 and 12 years. 3. These oscillations were synchronized at distances up to c. 1200 km within continents. There was no evidence for intraspecific synchrony of gypsy moth populations between continents. 4. We suggest that previous reports of interspecific synchrony among insects at scales much greater than 1000 km may suffer from spurious correlations among oscillating populations.},

abstract = {Although more consensus is now emerging on the magnitude and frequency of cascading trophic effects in aquatic communities, the debate over their terrestrial counterparts continues. We used meta- analysis to analyze field experiments on trophic cascades in terrestrial arthropod- dominated food webs to evaluate the overall magnitude of trophic cascades and conditions affecting their occurrence and strength. We found extensive support for the presence of trophic cascades in terrestrial communities. In the majority of experiments, predator removal led to increased densities of herbivorous insects and higher levels of plant damage. Cascades in which removing predators led to decreased herbivory also were detected but were less frequent and weaker, suggesting a predominantly three-trophic- level behavior of arthropod- dominated terrestrial food webs. Despite the clear evidence that cascades often decreased plant damage, residual effects of predation produced either no or only minimal changes in overall plant biomass. Agricultural systems and natural communities exhibited similarly strong effects of predation on herbivore abundance. However, resulting effects on plant damage and community- wide effects of trophic cascades on plant biomass usually were highly variable, and only in the managed agricultural systems did predators occasionally have strong indirect effects on plant biomass. Our meta- analysis suggests that the effects of trophic cascades on the biomass of primary producers are weaker in terrestrial than aquatic food webs.},

abstract = {We determined whether nematode-trapping fungi may influence the dynamics of a coastal shrub community. The food chain interactions in the shrub community involve the dominant plant species, its major insect herbivore, and an entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis hepialus. Of the 12 nematode-trapping fungi previously isolated from soils at the study site, 5 were selected for this study. Arthrobotrys oligospora, Geniculifera paucispora, Monacrosporium eudermatum, and Monacrosporium cionopagum efficiently trapped and colonized H. hepialus on agar; in contrast Nematoctonus concurrens trapped but did not infect or colonize the nematode on agar. To determine whether these fungi can suppress H. hepialus in soil, we added the fungi in the form of fungal-colonized nematodes to pasteurized (2 hr at 62 degrees C) and raw (nontreated) soil from the study site. Suppression was measured by comparing nematode invasion into a wax moth larva in fungus-treated and untreated soil in vials at 20 degrees C. Fungal population density in soil was estimated using dilution plating and most probable number procedures. All fungi suppressed H. hepialus if the wax moth larvae were added 4 days after the nematodes. Suppression ranged between 37 and 54\% and did not differ among fungi. Suppression was usually greater in raw than in pasteurized soil. Raw soil contained a constant background of nematode-trapping fungi, and A. oligospora was the most common among these; no background was detected in pasteurized soil. The presence of background fungi in raw soil may explain the higher suppression in raw than in pasteurized soil. Fungal propagule densities in our laboratory experiments were similar to those observed in the field, suggesting that nematode-trapping fungi may influence the dynamics of the plant, insect herbivore, and entomopathogenic nematode in the coastal ecosystem.

abstract = {I review models describing the dynamics of range expansion (spatial spread) of invading organisms, emphasizing two apparently robust results. First, there appears to be a linear rate of spread with time, and second, this rate is proportional to the per capita growth rate of the population wizen the invading species is rare. Both results hold for a variety of single-species and two-species models. I then present two models, one stochastic, and one with an Allee effect, that demonstrate that the constant linear rate of spread may only hold after an initial period of slower spread. Finally, I emphasize that the dependence of the rate of spread on the per capita growth rate need only hold when this is maximized when the species is rare. This last observation may have important implications for understanding the rate of spread for precisely those species which are likely to cause the most disruption to the communities they invade.

Thermal niche breadth for establishment within hosts was the widest for S. glaseri, (10-37 degrees C) and the narrowest for S. feltiae (8-30 degrees C). 3.

Steinernema scapterisci (20-32 degrees C), S. riobravis (20-35 degrees C), and Steinernema sp.

Although heterorhabditids are endemic to warmer climates, the upper thermal limits and temperature optima for reproduction of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and H. megidis were cooler than that of some of the steinernematids from South America and the Caribbean. 5. Thermal niche breadths did not differ between conspecific populations isolated from different localities, but were different for different species isolated from the same locality. 6.

abstract = {Free-ranging animals are exposed to a diverse array of parasitic worms, including nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans. Across host species, the number and types of parasite species are expected to depend on both host and parasite characteristics. We focused on helminth communities reported from free-living anthropoid primates to investigate factors associated with parasite diversity in a single host clade. We used a comparative data set of 305 host-parasite combinations representing 69 anthropoid primate species and 136 parasite species based on records obtained from the Host-Parasite Database at the Natural History Museum, London. We examined four sets of host characteristics that are predicted to influence parasite diversity in primates: host body size and life history; social contact and population density; diet; and individual ranging behaviour. We controlled for effects of uneven sampling effort on per-host measures of parasite diversity and repeated analyses with and without controlling for host phylogeny. In tests that did not control for host phylogeny, a large number of predictor variables were significantly associated with the diversity of both total helminths and nematode parasites, including body size, life-history variables and day range length. However, multivariate tests revealed that body mass and, to a lesser extent, social group size accounted for most variation in parasite species richness. Analyses that controlled for host phylogeny using independent contrasts showed that diet (estimated as the percentage of leaves in diet) was positively associated with total helminth and nematode parasite diversity in analyses that excluded outliers. Individual ranging behaviour was positively associated with the diversity of parasites with complex life cycles, including cestodes, trematodes and acanthocephalans. Our results demonstrate that several key features of host biology are likely to influence the community diversity of helminths in wild primate populations, including body size, diet, sociality and ranging behaviour.},

abstract = {The conceptualization of fragmented populations in terms of metapopulation theory has become standard over the last three decades. It is well known that increases in between-patch migration rates cause more synchronous population fluctuations and that this coherence increases the risk of global metapopulation extinction. Because species' migration rates and the probability of individuals surviving migration events depend on the effective distance between patches, the benefit of improving conservation corridors or the matrix between habitat patches has been questioned. As populations occur in the context of larger communities, moving from a metapopulation to a metacommunity model framework is a natural extension to address the generality of these conclusions. We show how considering a metacommunity can modify the conclusion that decreasing the effective distance between habitat patches (via improving matrix quality or other measures) necessarily increases the degree of metapopulation synchrony. We show that decreases in effective between-patch distance may deter population synchrony because of the simultaneous effect this change has on the migration patterns of other species. These results indicate that species interactions need to be considered when the effect of conservation measures on population synchrony, and ultimately persistence, is addressed.},

Survival of H. bacteriophora decreased linearly with time (4-70 d) and quadratically with increasing bulk density, whereas S, glaseri survival decreased linearly with time, but increased quadratically with increasing bulk density. Survival of S. carpocapsae decreased quadratically with time, but was unaffected by bulk density. H. bacteriophora and S. glaseri infected larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.) for up to 10 wk after soil inoculation, and the incidence of infection showed no significant variation in relation to bulk density or time. In contrast. infection rate by S. carpocapsae increased with bulk density and decreased with time. The combined effects of soil texture and bulk density on movement these of nematode species generally decreased as the bulk density of 3 soil textures increased. However, the degree to which soils of high bulk density reduced movement differed among species and soil textures: H. bacteriophora was the least restricted; whereas, S. carpocapsae was the most restricted. All 3 species moved significantly more in sandy loam; than in loam or silty clay loam. Although movement was reduced at relatively high bulk densities, survival of the 3 nematode species was high. Rates of movement and infection by the nematodes were strongly correlated with the amount of soil pore space having dimensions similar to or greater than the diameters of the nematodes. In a sandy loam soil, H. bacteriophora moved at least 18 cm within 4 d of soil inoculation across all bulk densities tested, whereas S. carpocapsae moved only 9 cm at the 3 lower densities and <9 cm at the highest soil density.

abstract = {Empirical studies show that local populations of predator and prey mites on plants frequently become extinct, because of both intrinsic local dynamics and traveling waves of predators that overwhelm local prey populations. Despite frequent local extinctions, the predator-prey metapopulation persists and exhibits either large-amplitude cycles or small-amplitude aperiodic fluctuations. This chapter reviews how our understanding of predator and prey metapopulation dynamics in mites has been advanced by comparing laboratory experiments with both a "baseline" model and simulation models that break down the assumptions of the "baseline" model. The most critical assumptions are that: 1) habitat structure matters, but spatial configuration does not; and 2) local dynamics of prey and predator are deterministic, fully determined by the first colonization and always end in prey extinction after a single oscillation, followed by predator dispersal. The "baseline" model predicts multiple stable states, either with or without predators, when there are many patches that harbor only few prey. Stable predator-prey cycles surface, however, when the number of patches is low and can harbor many prey. Virtually all acarine predator-prey metapopulation experiments published to date have been done under the latter conditions and show metapopulation-level cycles that are either periodic with large amplitudes or aperiodic with small amplitudes. Simulations suggest the large amplitude cycles arise when survival in the dispersal phase is low, whereas the small amplitude cycles surface when survival in the dispersal phase is relatively higher, yet low enough to allow persistence of predators and prey at the metapopulation level. The "baseline" model is further analyzed to detect which factors cause persistence or extinction at the metapopulation level. Persistence was promoted by prey dispersal from predator-occupied patches, time spent by prey in the dispersal phase, interception of predators in predator-occupied patches, and heterogeneous colonization risks among patches. Extinction is promoted by predator dispersal after extermination of prey in a patch and time spent by predators in the dispersal phase. The relative importance of all of these factors is yet to be determined. Moreover, the relevance of spatial patterning of predator-prey interactions is much debated. Model-based simulations to analyze an experimentally established time series suggest that what matters to persistence is reduced discovery of prey patches, not the spatial configuration per se. However, the last word has not been said about this, since spatial predator-prey models suggest configuration to play an important role. The "baseline" model is not evolutionary robust, in that its structure arises from individual traits that are not favored by natural selection. It is based on the assumption that first colonization is the single determinant of local predator or prey dynamics and that predator dispersal is delayed until after prey extermination. Delayed predator dispersal cannot evolve, however, when only the initial colonization of prey-only patches by a predator is taken into account. It also does not evolve in simulations with a model, parameterized for the acarine predator-prey system, in which not only the first colonization but also subsequent invasions are taken into account. However, observations on the behavior of field-collected predators show that delayed dispersal is the rule rather than the exception. We argue that delayed predator dispersal prevails in the field because local populations are subject to catastrophes which give predators little control over the exploitation of their local prey population. Hence, natural selection in the field will favor predators that exploit the local prey population as fast as possible and delay dispersal until after prey extermination. The important lesson to be drawn from this review is that the insights came from comparing a suite of models that all differed in key assumptions from a comprehensive yet formal "baseline" model and from testing these models against laboratory experiments. Understanding the complex dynamics observed in acarine predator-prey metapopulations requires more than spotting an arbitrary caricatural model with a dynamic behavior that corresponds qualitatively to that of the biological system.},

abstract = {Mean-field ecological models ignore space and other forms of contact structure. At the opposite extreme, high-dimensional models that are both individual-based and stochastic incorporate the distributed nature of ecological interactions. In between, moment approximations have been proposed that represent the effect of correlations on the dynamics of mean quantities. As an alternative closer to the typical temporal models used in ecology, we present here results on "modified mean-field equations" for infectious disease dynamics, in which only mean quantities are followed and the effect of heterogeneous mixing is incorporated implicitly. We specifically investigate the previously proposed empirical parameterization of heterogeneous mixing in which the bilinear incidence rate SI is replaced by a nonlinear term kS(p)I(q), for the case of stochastic SIRS dynamics on different contact networks, from a regular lattice to a random structure via small-world configurations. We show that, for two distinct dynamical cases involving a stable equilibrium and a noisy endemic steady state, the modified mean-field model approximates successfully the steady state dynamics as well as the respective short and long transients of decaying cycles. This result demonstrates that early on in the transients an approximate power-law relationship is established between global (mean) quantities and the covariance structure in the network. The approach fails in the more complex case of persistent cycles observed within the narrow range of small-world configurations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades have been documented in a diversity of ecological systems and can be important in determining biomass distribution within a community. To date, the literature on trophic cascades has focused on whether and in which systems cascades occur. Many biological (e.g., productivity : biomass ratios) and methodological (e.g., experiment size or duration) factors vary with the ecosystem in which data were collected, but ecosystem type, per se, does not provide mechanistic insights into factors controlling cascade strength. Here, we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31\% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18\% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus, although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores, future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems.},

abstract = {Pest management decisions should take into consideration quantitative information on dispersal of insect pests, but such information is often lacking. The goal of this study was to measure intraforest dispersal in the southern pine beetle (SPB). We developed an analytical formula for interpreting data from mark-recapture studies of insect dispersal. The formula is obtained by postulating a simple model of diffusion with disappearance (e.g., as a result of death) for the spread of marked insects from the release point. Parameters of the model (assumed to be invariant in space) are estimated by fitting the curve to the cumulative number of recaptured insects as a function of the distance from release. We also derived an expression for the distribution of dispersal distances in terms of the fitted parameters. The proposed methodology was applied to a mark-recapture study of SPB dispersal. Statistical analysis of recaptures-with-distance curves obtained in 11 replicate releases indicated that the proposed formula provided an accurate description of the data. There were no systematic departures from the functional relationship prescribed by the formula, and the model consistently outperformed another commonly used formula for fitting data on dispersal distances, the exponential curve. We explored the effect of spatial heterogeneity in the host distribution on SPB movement by regressing the deviation from the recapture rate predicted by the model in each trap on the pine basal area around the trap. This correlation was significantly greater than zero, indicating that beetles tended to aggregate in localities where pines were dense. This result suggests that a diffusion model with spatially varying parameters may provide a more accurate description of the redistribution process in the SPB. Quantitative results on SPB intraforest dispersal were summarized by calculating radii of circles enclosing a given proportion of SPB dispersal distances. For example, we estimated that one half of released beetles dispersed > 0.69 km. This result has important implications for evaluating the area-wide consequences of current or novel control tactics that rely on disrupting SPB movements, e.g., cut-and-leave and treatments with anti-congregation pheromone.},

Climate warming can increase pathogen development and survival rates, disease transmission, and host susceptibility. Although most host-parasite systems are predicted to experience more frequent or severe disease impacts with warming, a subset of pathogens might decline with warming, releasing hosts from disease. Recently, changes in El Nino Southern Oscillation events have had a detectable influence on marine and terrestrial pathogens, including coral diseases, oyster pathogens, crop pathogens, Rift Valley fever, and human cholera.

After a 24-h exposure to 10 000 infective juveniles/20 adult beetles, 45\% of the beetles died within 4 days post-treatment, but only 59\% of these were infected with the nematode. Corresponding control mortality was 6.5\%. An average of 238 infective juveniles were produced/beetle. Beetles exposed to 4000 and 10 000 infectives/10 adults carried with them an average of 17 and 59 infectives/adult on external body surfaces respectively. When beetles that had been exposed to 4000 infectives/20 adults were transferred to, and held in, cages containing soil for 2 weeks, lip to 89\% of the adults died, as did 74\% of the P. japonica larvae that were subsequently placed in the cages. When adults that had been exposed to 50 000 infectives/250 beetles in moist sand for 16 h were released into screened cages in the field at soil temperatures of over 25 degrees C, the soil beneath 83\% of the cages tested positive for the nematode, using Galleria mellonella larvae as bait, 2 weeks after releasing the beetles. No nematodes were detected in control plots. The potential of infected adult P, japonica for dispersing S. glaseri by flight was investigated by exposing adults to 50 000 infectives/250 beetles, marking and releasing them in the field and recapturing them in lure-baited Japanese beetle traps. Less than 1\% of the treated beetles were recaptured, but 33\% of these had one or more nematodes in their hemocoels. Accordingly, this approach does not appear to be feasible for large-scale augmentation and dispersal of the nematode using currently developed methods of infection. If improvements in mass-inoculation methods can be made that enable a rapid high percentage of infection while still permitting flight, this concept could be employed to establish new foci of infection or for the introduction of other species of nematodes.},

abstract = {For many important pathogens, mechanisms promoting antigenic variation, such as mutation and recombination, facilitate immune evasion and promote strain diversity. However, mathematical models have shown that host immune responses to polymorphic antigens can structure pathogen populations into discrete strains with nonoverlapping antigenic repertoires, despite recombination. Until now, models of strain evolution incorporating host immunity have assumed a randomly mixed host population. Here, we illustrate the effects of different host contact networks on strain diversity and dynamics by using a stochastic, spatially heterogeneous analogue of this model. For randomly mixed populations, our model confirms that cross-immunity to strains sharing alleles at antigenic loci may structure the pathogen population into discrete, nonoverlapping strains. However, this structure breaks down once the assumption of random mixing is relaxed, and an increasingly diverse pathogen population emerges as contacts between hosts become more localized. These results imply that host contact network structure plays a significant role in mediating the emergence of pathogen strain structure and dynamics.},

Between two and four weeks after emergence, their mobility increases and their nictation rate decreases, These alterations in behaviour suggested that a shift in foraging strategy from ambushing to a more mobile mode may occur. We tested this hypothesis by measuring changes in behaviours that may confer success to mobile foragers, including response to host cues and attachment to sedentary vs mobile hosts. We found that the success rate of ambushing declined with age, but there was no corresponding increase in the success rate of S. carpocapsae infective juveniles as mobile searchers, as measured in a sand column assay.

Mycoplasma gallisepticum is an emerging eye disease that spread rapidly among wild house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in the eastern United States following initial reports of infected birds in 1994. The hallmark signs of infection have allowed systematic monitoring of disease at both local and continent-wide scales for more than 7 years since the onset of the epidemic. 2. Using data collected by a network of citizen science volunteers, we examined both long-term trends and seasonal dynamics of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in three different climatic regions in eastern North America over a 77-month period (November 1994-March 2001). 3. Time-series prevalence data from all three regions suggest that following establishment, marked seasonal fluctuations in prevalence each year were characterized by autumn-winter epidemics (in October and February) and consistent summer declines (with prevalence falling close to zero from May to July). 4. The maximum peak, annual rates of increase and timing of epidemics varied among three geographical locations that were delineated by minimum winter temperatures. Annual autumn prevalence in the South increased more rapidly, and maximum prevalence was nearly three times greater in the South than in the colder North and Central regions. 5. Longer-term trends showed evidence for multiyear fluctuations in prevalence that were characterized by greater amplitude in the southern region. 6. Finally, monthly estimates of house finch flock sizes derived from a similar citizen science data set showed that winter flock sizes were associated positively with average monthly prevalence in the northern and central regions, although regional differences in flock sizes did not correspond to regional differences in maximum prevalence. 7. This study represents the first evidence of multiyear fluctuations, regional differences and highly predictable annual outbreaks of this recently emerged wildlife pathogen. Several factors associated with house finch life history and behaviour are likely to contribute to temporal and spatial variation in prevalence, including annual changes in host reproduction, social behaviour and environmental effects on host stress or immunocompetence.},

abstract = {The study of parasite virulence has generally focused on the conditions under which virulence is expected to increase or decrease over time and how the interactions between hosts and their environments may mediate the outcome of infection. Recently, parasite traits such as transmission, offspring production, and development have also been shown to be influenced by environmental variation. What is unclear is how variation in the parasite's environment may impact virulence. Recent theory demonstrates that plasticity can promote the evolution of decreased virulence; thus, understanding whether the parasite's environment can mediate virulence can improve predictions regarding the outcome of parasite infection. Here, an obligate mosquito parasite was reared in hosts fed high or low levels of food. Parasite oocysts (offspring) produced in these two host environments were subsequently fed to uninfected hosts. Parasites originating from well-fed hosts were found to be more virulent to these subsequent hosts compared to parasites originating from poorly fed hosts. Additionally, this effect was apparent only when current hosts were food deprived. These results demonstrate that parasite virulence was mediated by a cross-generational effect of the environment and that the overall outcome of infection was modified by variation in both the parasite's and host's environments.},

abstract = {Interactions between entomopathogenic nematode species with different foraging strategies were examined in the presence of two host species in soil. Based on differences in insect behavior and nematode pathogenicity, we hypothesized that black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), larvae would be more likely to serve as hosts for Steinernema carpocapsae or Steinernema riobravis, whereas masked chafer grubs, Cyclocephala hirta LeConte, would be more likely to serve as hosts for Steinernema glaseri. In the laboratory, the highest mortality of and nematode penetration in A. ipsilon were observed for S. carpocapsae followed by S. riobravis and S. glaseri. In C. hirta, substantial mortality and nematode penetration were only observed for S. glaseri. After combined applications of two nematode species, S. carpocapsae dominated over S. glaseri in A. ipsilon, whereas S. glaseri and S. riobravis shared the host resources. In C. hirta, S. glaseri outcompeted each of the other species. In the greenhouse, containers with turfgrass were inoculated with S. glaseri, S. carpocapsae, or S. riobravis, or combinations of S. glaseri with either S. carpocapsae or S. riobravis. Four days later, each container received seven A. ipsilon and nine C. hirta larvae, and new insects were added at 30-day intervals. The densities of infective juvenile nematodes were monitored over 150 days by taking soil samples from each container. In the single species treatments, numbers of S. carpocapsae and S. riobravis increased after 30 days, decreased thereafter and remained low. Steinernema glaseri numbers fluctuated between low and high densities. In the combination of S. glaseri and S. calpocapsae, both species were depressed compared with the single species treatment. In the combination of S. glaseri and S. riobravis, both species coexisted and showed parallel fluctuations but S. glaseri dominated numerically. Our observations indicate that two entomopathogenic nematode species may successfully coexist in an area by having different foraging strategies that separate nematode species spatially, exhibiting host specificity, and occupying a different niche. In the field, patchy distribution and alternate hosts may also support nematode coexistence.},

abstract = {This study describes the basic ecological characteristics of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema monticolum that was originally isolated from soil in a mountain forest on Mount Jiri, Republic of Korea. Under laboratory conditions, S. monticolum infected a wide range of insect species but appeared best adapted to lepidopteran larvae as hosts. It uses an intermediate foraging strategy with a low attachment rate to mobile hosts on the soil surface and poor infection of sedentary hosts placed at greater than or equal to5 cm soil depth. S. monticolum infected hosts over a wide range of soil moisture ranging from -1500 kPa to -3 kPa. It has a wide thermal activity range with optimum infectivity from 12 to 25 degreesC. When stored in water over a 6 month period, S. monticolum persisted well from 5 to 25 degreesC. Its infectivity also remained high when stored from 5 to 15 degreesC but declined faster at 25 degreesC. Because of its foraging strategy and adaptation to cool temperatures, S. monticolum has potential for the control of pests, especially Lepidoptera, that hibernate in the upper soil layer or soil litter.},

abstract = {Entomopathogenic nematodes are used for inundative biological control of insect pests but also have potential for use in augmentative and/or inoculative biological control. Numerous new species are being described but generally, Little information is provided on their ecology. Moreover, many species have been described previously without subsequent ecological information. This paper presents a number of simple experiments examining a nematode's physiological host range, host-foraging behavior, thermal activity range, and soil moisture activity range that provides the basic information necessary for further studies of a new species as a biological control agent. We suggest that any taxonomic description of new species should be combined with such an ecological study. This kind of information should also be generated for species in which no ecological studies have been done. In our study, we found that the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema rarum which was described in 1986 infected a wide range of arthropod species under laboratory conditions but appeared to be best adapted to lepidopteran larvae as hosts. It used an intermediate foraging strategy infecting both mobile hosts on the soil surface and sedentary hosts below the soil surface efficiently. The range of soil moisture at which S. rarum was effective suggested an adaptation to the fluctuating soil moisture in the upper soil layers. Its temperature optimum of 25 degrees C corresponded well to the warm temperate climate of its area of origin in Argentina. The optimal storage temperature was around 15 degrees C. Our study suggests that S. rarum is well adapted to lepidopteran hosts with larvae spending part of their live on the soil surface and/or that pupate in the soil. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The calculation of most probable numbers (mpn) was used for the estimation of numbers of infective entomopathogenic nematodes in soil. The mpn concept was first introduced in bacteriology as a means of estimating numbers of organisms in a substrate without a direct count, in cases where direct enumeration could not be applied. In the work reported here, soil samples infested with infective juveniles (IJs) of Heterorhabditis megidis (isolate HF85) were diluted with uninfested soil and the diluted soils were baited with mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor). The mpn of infective units of IJs in the undiluted soil was calculated. The mpn calculation was found to be applicable to entomopathogenic nematodes in soil under particular conditions. It could be successfully applied to data for the response of soil units but not to the data based on the response of individual insects, as the latter did not confirm to a Poisson series. The calculated mpn represented between 2.9 and 7.1\% of the initial inoculum of IJs. It was suggested that IJs might act as a group in infecting an insect host. Using the data for Tenebrio mortality on parasitisation, the mpn based on quantal response of the mealworms would therefore not give the true density of IJs in the soil sample but the effective density, or the quantity of infective units. Although the biological significance of the infective unit needs further clarification, mpn was found to be a useful parameter for use in comparative experiments.},

abstract = {Landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology share a common interest in developing measures that describe the structure of heterogeneous landscapes, but the specific aim in metapopulation ecology is to construct measures that help predict the dynamics of species with information about the structure of fragmented landscapes. The amount of habitat that individuals in a metapopulation have access to can be divided into four components, the amount of habitat in the present habitat parch (A(i)), the amount of connected habitat in other patches available via migration (Gamma(i)), the amount of presented habitat in the present patch after time period Delta t(A(i)'). and the amount of linked habitat in other patches after time period Delta t(Gamma(i)'). Deterministic threshold conditions for metapopulation persistence in patch networks can be approximated with these quantities. For instance, in a version of the Levins model with er;tinction risk proportional to the inverse of patch area and colonization probability proportional to patch connectivity, the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence is given by <(Gamma A)over bar> +Var(Gamma A)/<(Gamma A)over bar> > e/c, where e and c are the species-specific extinction and colonization parameters. I conjecture that with measures A' and Gamma' the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence can be extended to dynamic landscapes, in which all or part of population turnover is caused by turnover in the habitat patches themselves. The measures of habitat availability described in this paper can be used to rank dissimilar fragmented landscapes in terms of their capacity to support a viable metapopulation.},

abstract = {Based on several years of data from two populations of the endangered Apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo, L. 1758), we study how the amount and spatial location of patches of larval (host-plant) and adult (nectar plant) resources affects the distribution of females and their larval offspring in the following year. In the coastal population (nectar-plant and host-plant patches spatially segregated), females moved frequently between patches to aggregate on larger host-plant patches close to nectar-plant patches. In the archipelago population (where nectar-plants and host-plants co-occur), the abundance of females increased with higher proximity to other host-plant patches and with more nectar-plants on the patch. Next year's larval abundance correlated with the abundance of females in the previous season in both populations. A model of the population dynamics in the two populations in relation to the spatial configuration of nectar and host-plant patches showed that the spatial configuration of larval and adult resources had population-dynamical consequences. In many organisms, different life-history stages use different resources. Incorporation of information on the location and abundance of adult resources can provide additional insight for the suitability of a particular landscape in harbouring a population.

The estimation of nematode density is based on a strong linear relationship between the log(10) of the number of nematode-infected bait insects and the log(10) of the number of nematodes found in these bait insects. This relationship was tested for two nematode species in field samples of natural populations and for three nematode species and three soil types in the laboratory.

abstract = {Local instability of exploiter-victim systems is well-known in both theory and in nature. Victims can be too sparse to support exploiter reproduction (under-exploitation) or they can be too readily driven to extinction (over-exploitation). Exploiters of seasonal resources face the additional challenge of surviving periods when victims are rare or unavailable. We formulate a fully stochastic model of highly seasonal pathogen-host dynamics and explore the interactions between an entomopathogenic nematode and its lepidopteran host. Our model suggests that if nematode populations experience the high rates of mortality predicted by short-term laboratory experiments, the paired threats of under- and over-exploitation should preclude the long-term persistence of this exploiter-victim system. We measured nematode mortality rates in the field and found that long-term mortality is lower than that predicted by short-term experiments. Incorporation of this new data into our model produces long-term persistence of local nematode populations across a range of initial nematode densities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new species of soil-dwelling entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis hepialus killed up to 100\% (mean = 72\%) of root-boring caterpillars of a ghost moth Hepialus californicus in coastal shrub lands. When unchecked, ghost moth caterpillars killed bush lupine, Lupinus arboreus. Here we describe this strange food chain. Although unappreciated by ecologists, entomopathogenic nematodes are widespread and probably one of the most important groups of natural enemies for underground insects. The free-living infective juvenile (IJ) of entomopathogenic nematodes searches for host insects in the soil. A single IJ can kill a host, although several often invade together. After entering the host through a spiracle or other orifice, the IJ regurgitates its symbiotic bacterium, Photorhabdus luminescens, which kills the host within 48 h. The bacteria digest the cadaver and provide food for the exponentially growing nematode population inside. The bacteria produce antibiotics and other noxious substances that protect the host cadaver from other microbes in the soil. When the cadaver is exhausted of resources, IJs break the host integument and can disperse. As many as 420,000 IJs can be produced within a large ghost moth caterpillar. Surface soil of the lupine rhizosphere is the primary habitat of IJs of H. hepialus. Attracted to waste gases emitted by insects, the 0.5-mm-long IJs can move 6 cm/day through moist soil. Prevalences of H. hepialus ranged from as high as 78\% of rhizospheres in some lupine stands to almost zero in others, but it was absent from no stand at our study site. Field intensities ranged from 0.003 IJs/cm(3) of soil to 7.5 IJs/cm(3), and correlated roughly with prevalences among sites. Few ghost moth caterpillars (mean = 6.7) succeeded in entering lupine roots where prevalence of H. hepialus was highest, and this stand had lowest mortality (0.02) of mature bush lupine. In the three stands with lowest prevalence (mean = 2\%) of this nematode, many caterpillars (mean = 38.5) entered roots, and lupine mortality was high (range = 0.41-1.0). Old aerial photographs indicate that the stands with highest recent nematode prevalence have had little or no mass die-off of lupine over the past 40 years. The photos depict repeated die-offs of lupine during the past four decades in stands with lowest recent prevalence of the nematode. This pattern leads us to entertain the hypothesis that the nematode affects vegetation dynamics indirectly through a trophic cascade. Dispersal of entomopathogenic nematodes is little understood. We found that air drying of soil extirpates H. hepialus and speculate that this nematode is dispersed during the wet season in moist soil bits on the exterior of fossorial insects and mammals. H. hepialus colonized some previously unoccupied lupine rhizospheres during the wet winter-spring season and, obversely, became extinct from some rhizosperes as soil dried in summer. Root-feeding insects have only recently been recognized as a force in communities, and the regulation of these important herbivores is still largely an ecological term incognita. All evidence indicates that entomopathogenic nematodes are found throughout terrestrial ecosystems, and we propose that trophic chains similar to those described in this report should not be uncommon.},

abstract = {The endemic persistence of infectious diseases can often not be understood without taking into account the relevant heterogeneities of host mixing. Here, we consider spatial heterogeneity, defined as 'patchiness' of the host Population. After briefly reviewing how disease persistence is influenced by population size, reproduction number and infectious period, we explore its dependence on the level of spatial heterogeneity. Analysis and simulation of disease transmission in a symmetric meta-population suggest that disease persistence typically becomes worse as spatial heterogeneity increases, although local persistence optima call occur for infections with oscillatory population dynamics. We obtain insight into the dynamics that underlie the observed persistence patterns by studying the infection prevalence correlation between patches and by comparing full-model simulations to results obtained using simplified patch-level descriptions of the interplay between local extinctions and between-patch transmissions. The observed patterns are interpreted in terms of rescue effects for strong spatial heterogeneity and in terms of between-patch coherence and synchronization effects at intermediate and weak levels of heterogeneity.

Under laboratory conditions, S. scarabaei infected a limited range of insect species and appeared best adapted to scarab larvae as hosts. It uses a widely ranging foraging strategy with a low attachment rate to mobile hosts on the soil surface but with excellent infection of sedentary host placed at greater than or equal to 2 cm soil depth. It has a wide thermal activity range with optimum infectivity from 17.5 to 25 degreesC. Because of its foraging strategy and adaptation to scarab larvae as hosts, S. scarabaei has outstanding potential for the control of scarab pests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Cascading effects from a third level consumer to the basal plant level. have been documented several times in terrestrial systems. However, less is known about how these effects are influenced by characteristics of the host plant population. To examine if properties of the spatial context can affect tritrophic interactions we studied 85 populations of a perennial plant, Actaea spicata, the associated speciatist moth seed predator, Eupithecia immundata and a guild of parasitoids. Based on the Fretwett-Oksanen model we developed a hypothesis for how the level of herbivory is related to the spatial aggregation of plant populations. In agreement with predictions, incidences of both higher trophic levels were correlated to plant population size. However, there was no effect of population connectivity or environmental parameters. Seed predation was unimodally related to population size with the highest levels in populations of intermediate size. In small populations, usually either a high proportion of seeds was preyed upon due to seed predator presence and parasitoid absence or there was no seed predation when the seed predator was absent. Intermediately sized plant populations suffered from intense seed predation since the seed predator was present but parasitoids were often not. In all. large plant populations parasitoids reduced the level of seed predation, thereby enhancing plant fitness. The effects of predation on seed output was correlated with effects on plant population structure, in terms of the proportion of seedlings. Our results demonstrate that host plant population size is important for the distribution of herbivores and their natural enemies, as well as for the outcome of the tritrophic interaction. Moreover, natural enemies of a specialist herbivore might have long-term cascading effects in terms of changes in plant population structure. (c) 2005 Gesettschaft fur Okologie.

The present study compares patterns of spatial synchrony in outbreaks of six epidemic bark beetle species in North America and Europe. Spatial synchrony among populations of the Eurasian spruce bark beetle Ips typographus was significantly higher than for the other bark beetle species. The spatial synchrony observed in epidemic bark beetles was also compared with previously published patterns of synchrony in outbreaks of defoliating forest Lepidoptera, revealing a marked difference between these two major insect groups. The bark beetles exhibited a generally lower degree of spatial synchrony than the Lepidoptera, possibly because bark beetles are synchronized by different weather variables that are acting on a smaller scale than those affecting the Lepidoptera, or because inherent differences in their dynamics leads to more cyclic oscillations and more synchronous spatial dynamics in the Lepidoptera.},

A recent analysis by Hess has pointed out a possible exception to this: when infectious disease is present, migration may promote disease spread and therefore increase local extinction. We extend Hess's model to discuss this problem: when infections have spilled over from more abundant alternative hosts. This is often the case for species of conservation concern, and we find that Hess's conclusions must be substantially modified. We use deterministic analytic and stochastic numerical approaches to show that movement between patches will rarely have a negative impact, even when the probability of external infection is low.},

A series of five laboratory experiments were conducted with six to eight nematode strains in each and one or more nematode strains in common, so that qualitative comparisons could be made across experiments. Nematodes included Heterorhabditis bacteriophara (four strains), H. indica (Hom1), H. marelatus (Point Reyes), H. megidis (UK211), H. mexicana (MX4), Steinernema carpocapsae (eight strains), S. diaprepesi, S. feltiae (SN), S. glaserz (NJ43), S. rarum (17C\&E), and S. riobrave (nine strains). Substantial within-species variation in longevity was observed in S. carpocapsae, with the Sal strain exhibiting the greatest survival. The Sal strain was used as a standard in all inter-species comparisons. In contrast, little intra-species variation was observed in S. riobrave. Overall, we estimated S. carpocapsae (Sal) and S. diaprepesi to have the highest survival capability. A second level of longevity was observed in H. bacteriophora (Lewiston), H. megidis, S. feltiae, and S. riobrave (3-3 and 355). Lower levels of survivability were observed in other H. bacteriophora strains (Hb, HP88, and Oswego), as well as S. glaseri and S. rarum. Relative to S. glaserz and S. rarum, a lower tier of longevity was observed in H. indica and H. marelatus, and in H. mexicana, respectively. Although nematode persistence can vary under differing soil biotic and abiotic conditions, baseline data on longevity such as those reported herein may be helpful when choosing the best match for a particular target pest.},

abstract = {Our objectives were to determine whether entomopathogenic nematode emergence from host cadavers is influenced by soil moisture, whether the nematodes can survive adverse desiccating conditions in the soil by remaining within the host cadaver, and whether differences in such an adaptation occur among. species. In the first experiment, wax moth larvae killed by Steinernema glaseri, Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema riobravis, or Heterorhabditis bacteriophora were placed in soil water potentials ranging from -500 MPa (very dry) to -0.006 MPa (moist). No infective juveniles (IJs) emerged from cadavers at -500 MPa, and only few S. glaseri and S. carpocapsae emerged at -40 MPa. Large numbers of IJs emerged at greater than or equal to -5 MPa from cadavers containing S. carpocapsae, S. glaseri, or H. bacteriophora. S. riobravis emerged only at greater than or equal to -0.3 MPa. In the second experiment, cadavers were left in dry soil (-40 MPa) for various periods of time before being rehydrated. The number of IJs emerging per cadaver and the infectivity of the emerged IJs were determined. IJ emergence declined with the time that the cadavers were left in dry soil. Regression analysis predicted that IJ emergence from cadavers with S. glaseri, S. carpocapsae, H. bacteriophora, or S. riobravis would stop after 27, 62, 80, and 111 days, respectively, in dry soil. We hypothesize that S. carpocapsae, a sit-and-wait forager, survives longer than S. glaseri because it is adapted to infect insects near the soil surface, whereas S. glaseri, an actively searching forager, is adapted to infect insects deeper in the soil profile. Cadavers colonized by S. carpocapsae, therefore, are more likely to be exposed to dehydrating conditions, H. bacteriophora, an actively searching forager, may survive longer within cadavers because the gummous consistency of its host cadavers retains moisture very efficiently. S. riobravis may survive for considerable lengths of time within cadavers in adaptation to the subtropical, semiarid climate of its geographic area of origin. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The extinction of small populations is a stochastic process, affected by both environmental variation and chance variation in the fates of individuals (demographic stochasticity). Here I examine how population extinction risk is affected by variation in the underlying individual phenotypes, using a branching-process approach. I define the long-term individual extinction risk as the chance of ultimately leaving no descendants, and the cumulative individual extinction risk as the chance of leaving no descendants by a specified time. I use these to show that if there is a phenotypic correlation between parents and their offspring, variation in these quantities always reduces both the long- and short-term population extinction risk. Such variation in individual extinction risk arises from individual variation in demographic parameters and may have both genetic and environmental causes. Using a well-known approximation of the difference between the log arithmetic and log geometric means, I derive expressions for the sensitivity and elasticity of the approximate log extinction risk to changes in the mean and variance of the individual extinction risk, and, to changes in population size. One conclusion is that increasing the variance among individuals in extinction risk can sometimes be at least as important in reducing population extinction risk as increasing,the population size itself. These analyses also point to reasons why changes in environmental factors (e.g., toxicants) or management practices may have either larger or smaller effects than would be anticipated by considering the change in the mean risk alone.},

abstract = {There is interspecific variation in infective juvenile behavior within the entomopathogenic nematode genus Steinernema. This variation is consistent with rise of different foraging strategies along a continuum between ambush and cruise foraging. To address questions about the evolution of foraging strategy, behavioral and morphological characters were mapped onto a phylogeny of Steinernema. Three species, all in the same clade, were classified as ambushers based on standing bout duration and host-finding ability. One clade of six species were all cruisers based on both host-finding and lack of standing behavior. All species in the ambusher clade had a high rate of jumping, all species in the cruiser clade had no jumping, and most intermediate foragers exhibited some level of jumping. Response to volatile and contact host cues was variable, even within a foraging strategy. Infective Juveniles in the ambusher clade were all in the smallest size category, species in the cruiser clade were in the largest size categories, and intermediate foragers tended to be more intermediate in size. We hypothesize that the ancestral Steinernema species was an intermediate forager and that ambush and cruise foraging both evolved at least once in the genus},

Mulch treatments were applied once each year to stud), the effects of altering the community of EPN competitors (free-living bactivorous nematodes) and antagonists (nematophagous fungi (NF), predaceous nematodes and some microarthropods). EPN were augmented once with Steinernema riobrave in 2004 and twice in 2005. Adding EPN to soil affected the prevalence of organisms at several trophic levels, but the effects were often ephemeral and sometimes inconsistent. EPN augmentation always increased the mortality of sentinel weevil larvae, the prevalence of free-living nematodes in sentinel cadavers and the prevalence of trapping NF. Subsequent to the insecticidal effects of EPN augmentation in 2004, but not 2005, EPN became temporarily less prevalent, and fewer sentinel weevil larvae died in EPN-augmented compared to non-augmented plots. Manure mulch had variable effects on endoparasitic NF, but consistently decreased the prevalence of trapping NF and increased the prevalence of EPN and the sentinel mortality. Both temporal and spatial abundance of NF were inversely related to the prevalence of Steinernema diaprepesi, whereas Heterorhabditis zealandica prevalence was positively correlated with NF over time. The number of weevil larvae killed by EPN was likely greatest in 2005, due in part to non-target effects of augmentation on the endemic EPN community in 2004 that occurred during a period of peak weevil recruitment into the soil.},

The infective juveniles had been uniformly distributed in the soil. At a water potential of -0.006 megaPascal (MPa) in a sandy loam soil, nematode establishment at different depths was variable in both species. S. carpocapsae tended to establish at equal numbers in hosts at depths between 0 and 10 cm, whereas S. glaseri showed consistent establishment from 2 to 10 cm but was variable at 0 cm. Tests in 1-liter cups and 3-ml arenas showed that soil moisture affected nematode establishment. S. carpocapsae started establishing in hosts at -5 MPa water potential in 3-ml arenas and -0.3 MPa in 1-liter cups (low soil moistures) and had the highest establishment numbers between -0.1 and -0.01 MPa. At higher soil moistures, the number of nematodes establishing dropped significantly, especially in the 1-liter cups. The establishment range for S. glaseri was more restricted at the low soil moistures. It started establishing in hosts at -0.3 MPa in the 3-ml arenas and -0.05 MPa in the 1-liter cups, respectively. Its establishment numbers increased constantly at higher soil moistures but dropped in the 1-liter containers in water-saturated soil (-0.003 MPa). Although S. glaseri did not infect hosts after 24 hr exposure to very dry soil (-40 MPa), some S. carpocapsae still established in hosts after this exposure when the sail was rewetted to -0.006 MPa. Generally, S. carpocapsae performed better in drier conditions than S. glaseri. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Our objective was to determine the manner in which the presence of the S. feltiae-X. bovienii nematode-bacterium complex affected infectivity and reproduction of M. incognito in tomato roots (cv. Rutgers). Tests demonstrated that a common application rate of S. feltiae for insect control, 2.5 billion/ha (scaled to our laboratory and greenhouse tests), significantly decreased M. incognito galling, egg production, and egg hatch rate. Two time course experiments were conducted against M. incognito with rates of S. feltiae that corresponded to the effective concentrations. In the first time course experiment, M. incognito and S. feltiae were applied the same day to tomato seedlings in sand. Twelve plants were assessed destructively each week for 6 weeks after inoculation with the two nematode species. Neither M. incognito penetration rate nor developmental rate was affected by S. feltiae application. Egg production per plant and egg hatch rate were significantly reduced in the treated plants. However, the number of eggs per egg mass in treatment plants was not different from that in control plants. The average number of galls per plant 6 weeks after the initial inoculation was lower in the treated plants than in the control plants. In the second time course experiment, the same rate of S. feltiae was applied to sand in which plants already infected with M. incognita had been transplanted. Development of nematodes inside the root was not affected by S. feltiae in the sand. Galling 6 weeks after the application was again less in the treatment than in the control plants. The presence of the S. feltiae-X. bovienii complex at a density that reflects the recommended field application rate had suppressive effects on M. incognito in these laboratory trials. Our data show that S. feltiae applications decrease M. incognito galling, egg production per plant, and egg hatch but not individual female egg production. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This study explores the consequences of predator-mediated coexistence among competitors for patterns of incidence and diversity at local and regional scales. We develop a model that draws on elements of metapopulation models of competitors and food chains by allowing competitors to coexist locally in the presence of predators but not in their absence. The model predicts that predators promote regional coexistence by greatly expanding the range of conditions under which two competitors persist at equilibrium. Predators could have positive or negative effects on mean local diversity within the region depending on their dispersal rates, those of the prey, and their effects on prey extinction rates. The presence of predators increased the abundance of inferior competitors, thereby expanding the conditions for positive relationships between local and regional diversity. The model also predicted positive correlations between local diversity of predators and prey. These predictions were supported by patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish species richness among lakes. The model may help to resolve the apparent contrast between linear patterns of local and regional richness and experimental evidence for strong invasion resistance and rapid dispersal in zooplankton},

abstract = {The effect of landscape mosaic on recurrent traveling waves in spatial population dynamics was studied via simulation modeling across a theoretical landscape with varying levels of connectivity. Phase angle analysis was used to identify locations of wave epicenters on patchy landscapes. Simulations of a tri-trophic model of the larch budmoth (Zeiraphera diniana) with cyclic population dynamics on landscapes with a single focus of high-density habitat produced traveling waves generally radiating outwardly from single and multiple foci and spreading to isolated habitats. We have proposed two hypotheses for this result: (1) immigration subsidies inflate population growth rates in the high connectivity habitat and, thus, reduce the time from valleys to peaks in population cycles; (2) populations in the high connectivity habitat crash from peaks to valleys faster than in an isolated habitat due to over-compensatory density dependence. While population growth rates in the high connectivity habitat benefitted from immigration subsidies, times from population valleys to peaks were greater in high connectivity habitat due to a greater magnitude of fluctuations. Conversely, the mean time of the crash from population peaks to valleys was shorter in high connectivity habitat, supporting the second hypothesis. Results of this study suggest over-compensatory density dependence as an underlying mechanism for recurrent traveling waves originating in high connectivity habitats aggregated around a single focus.},

abstract = {Populations are characterized by variability among individuals, a result
of both intrinsic differences among individuals and environmental
effects on individual performance. Despite the ubiquity of individual
variation, its implications for population model choice are,not fully
understood. Population models that use state variables representing
individual features such as age or size assume that these state
variables can predict the population trajectory. However, State
variables are often chosen based on convenience or necessity; only
rarely are they tested for importance and accuracy when individuals
vary. We examined whether matrix projection models, a common choice in
population modeling, provide accurate predictions when individuals vary
in a population. With both density-dependent and density-independent
formulations, we tested whether matrix projection models that used size
as a state variable captured the dynamics of populations projected with
an individual-based simulation (or i-state configuration model). We
varied the initial size distribution of individuals, the degree to
which. individual growth was size dependent, the tendency for positive
correlations in growth through time, and the amount of stochasticity in
growth, and we, asked what conditions affect the accuracy of matrix
models. Stochasticity alone did not compromise the predictions of matrix
models; rather, only populations with individual variation generated by
strong size-dependent growth and growth correlations were poorly
described by matrix models. Otherwise, matrix models captured the
trajectories of populations with a fair degree of accuracy. Overall, our
results provide guidance as to when and how individual variation must be
included in population projections, and when a simple matrix model
framework is inadequate.},

abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.},

abstract = {The work presented examines the effects of soil moisture on the virulence of selected entomopathogenic nematode isolates in the laboratory and has broad implications for managing soil-dwelling insects in all production systems. Two species of entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Oswego and Tuscarora strains) and Steinernema glaseri (NCl strain), were applied to sandy loam soils ranging from below the permanent wilting point of plants to near saturation. Fluctuations in soil moisture were created by simulating a rainfall or irrigation event (i.e., rehydration), or by allowing soil to dry. Nematode virulence was evaluated by measuring insect mortality in Galleria mellonella larvae bioassays. Soils prepared at four moisture contents were inoculated with nematodes and subsequently bioassayed at their original moisture contents and after rehydration, over an 18-mo period. Insect mortality increased with soil moisture content for both H. bacteriophora isolates but was highest in relatively low moisture soils (approximate to-15 bar) for S. glaseri. Insect mortality was generally low in low-moisture soils before rehydration but rebounded to high levels posthydration. Both isolates of H. bacteriophora nematodes were reactivated to cause high insect mortality (greater than or equal to 98\%) as long as 18 mo after infective juveniles were inoculated into very low moisture soils (approximate to-30 bar). The posthydration insect mortality levels in the S. glaseri treatments were significantly lower than in the H. bacteriophora treatments. For all nematode treatments, the cumulative insect mortality of prehydration and posthydration bioassays was higher in lower moisture soils compared with higher moisture soils. In an additional experiment, moisture thresholds for activation of nematodes in dry soil were determined},

abstract = {Most empirical and theoretical studies of resource use and population dynamics treat conspecific individuals as ecologically equivalent. This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

## Introduction
It is now well established the food webs can be regulated by organisms other than large predators. Microparasites play a strong role in structuring communities. In coastal CA, we have shown that a seasonal microparasite can interact in idiosyncratic ways with local climate to influence population dynamics of a herbivorous moth [@Gruner2009]. The species is small and limited in dispersal range [@Ram2008a]. Since all estimates to date have been in the lab, and not the field, we established what might be the first field trial of entomopathogenic nematode dispersal.

## Study system
BML.

## Methods

We sampled 40 plots over 7 weeks in year 1. Then sampled the same plots again in year 2.

We thank Beth Lenz, Preston Malm, and May Roberts for assistance in the field. Discussions with Dan Gruner and John McLaughlin improved the design of the experiment. Dan Gruner, Evan Preisser and two anonymous reviewers provided useful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript. This effort was supported by funding from NSF DEB \#0620475 to D.R. Strong and travel grants from the Bodega Marine Lab to K. Ram. This is a contribution of the Bodega Marine Lab, University of California, Davis.
